<p>A silly reverse shell invoked via the Composer Dependency Manager. <a href="https://github.com/leonjza/composer-shell">Source here</a></p>

<p><a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>, which is most probably <em>the</em> most popular PHP dependency manager allows for <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md">scripts</a> to run as callbacks on based an event.
Callbacks are normally triggered just before or after certain events.</p>

<p>It is possible to provide shell commands to the <code>scripts</code> property in the required <code>composer.json</code> file (with a few restrictions), but this method echoes the command that it executes.
A slightly more covert approach would be to execute a cleverly named static function in a class included in the codebase. It has to be one that can be autoloaded by composer.</p>

<p>Recently I became aware of the <a href="http://canarytokens.org">canarytokens</a> project by the guys over at <a href="http://thinkst.com/">Thinkst</a>. The basic idea is to manipulate things like documents / services in such a way that usage thereof will trigger an alert via some form of &lsquo;phone home&rsquo; feature. The is most probably better known as &lsquo;honeydocs&rsquo;. In the case of <a href="http://canarytokens.org">canarytokens</a>, the phone home features can be either via a DNS or HTTP request coupled with a unique token. As paraphrased from the projects website, this is no new groundbreaking idea but just another usable one.</p>

<p>In this post, I just want to take a few moments and jot down my findings when investigating the documents generated by this project.</p>

      tl;dr Flick II just got published on Vulnhub! You should try it =) introduction After about a year since Flick I, I have finally managed to get Flick II out to VulnHub. I learned a lot from Flick I and as a result applied it to Flick II. The making of Flick II was also a very different story. If I have to compare it to the first one (which took 3 nights to build start to finish), Flick II took waay longer.

<p>Recently I came across a few <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> continuous integration servers. A relatively old version I might add but that fact was not important. What was important though was the fact that it was not configured to be <em>&lsquo;secure&rsquo;</em>. Right out of the box Jenkins does not require any authentication to make use of it. In fact, it seems like its almost plug and play.</p>

<p>Recently I decided I wanted to have a look at what <a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/">Exploit Exercises</a> had to offer. I was after the memory corruption related exploitation stuff to play with, until I saw the details for <a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/">Nebula</a>. <em>Nebula covers a variety of simple and intermediate challenges that cover Linux privilege escalation, common scripting language issues, and file system race conditions.</em></p>

<p>I did not really have a lot of time on my hands and figured I should start with the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; stuff. Many of the levels Nebula presented were in fact very, very easy. However, towards final levels my knowledge was definitely being tested. Levels started taking much longer to complete as I was yet again realizing that the more you learn, the more you realize you you still have to learn. :)</p>

<p>This is the path I took to solve the 20 challenges.</p>

<p>Sokar was used as another writeup competition (the first for 2015), similar to the <a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/09/18/from-persistence/">Persistence</a> challenge from Sep &lsquo;14.
From the <a href="http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/competition-sokar.html">competition announcement blogpost</a>, the rules of engagement were pretty familiar. Boot the VM, pwn it via the network and find the flag.
Of course, modifying the VM in order to help you get the flag (things like single user mode, rescue disks etc) are not allowed and you have to actually be able to prove how you got r00t.</p>

<p>Sokar frustrated me. A lot. However, almost all of the challenges and configurations of Sokar were plausible. Most of the vulnerabilities are valid in the sense that it may as well be out there in wild. So, it was a great learning experience once again!</p>

<p>Here is my entry for the competition. Enjoy! :)</p>

<p>Not too long ago, I toyed with a <a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/02/09/no-more-jailbreak-detection-an-adventure-into-android-reversing-and-smali-patching/">Android root detection bypass</a>. In a similar scenario, I was poking at a iOS application that also had some root detection built in. For very much the same purpose, I suppose the application has its own ~reasons~ for the jailbreak detection. Of course, this makes the testing I <em>actually</em> wanted to do impossible as I&rsquo;d very much like to dig under the hood :)</p>

        <img src="https://leonjza.github.io/images/ios_jailbreak_logo.png" />

<p>So, its was time to try and bypass the jailbreak detection of the application.
All I had to work with was a <code>.ipa</code>. Similar to the android <code>.apk</code> file, the <code>.ipa</code> is also just a zipped up archive of the actual application files. To test with, I had a iPad mini. The iPad was running the latest iOS (8.1.2 at the time of this post) and was also jailbroken. If I remember correctly the jailbreak tool used was called TaiG. Anyways, inside the applications <code>.ipa</code> archive was a whole bunch of resource files and what not, including the compiled application executable. This executable is what is of interest.</p>

<p>I will start by saying that I am by <em>no means</em> a expert in anything you are about to read. I am also not 100% sure about the correct terminology for this type of patching. Maybe it should have been called binary patching? I don&rsquo;t know, but I do know that I was quite literally shocked by the ease of getting this job done, and figured its time to make some notes for me to reflect on later again.</p>

<p>Recently I had the opportunity to poke at an Android <code>.apk</code>. My task was a little different from what I am about to blog about, but the fundamental idea remained the same. I wanted to inspect some traffic of an application, but the application had jailbreak detection built in and refused to run if the device its running on is detected as jailbroken. This had to be bypassed first. To play with the <code>apk</code>, I needed to get some tools setup and learn a few things about the Android environment <em>really</em> fast. There are tons of resources available online to describe to you the general idea behind Android, as well as how its all stitched together. You will quickly come to realize that apps can be written in Java. For the purpose of this post, the focus is to bypass the jailbreak detection the <code>apk</code> had and let it continue normal operations.</p>

Pegasus had its fair share of frustrations and had me digging around quite a bit. I did however learn a very valuable lesson&hellip; <em>again</em>. You will see this in the <strong>my_first</strong> section.</p>

<p>Like many other write ups I do, I will also recommend you try this one first before you read on. For me, Pegasus was definitely slightly more difficult than the usual VulnHub stuff you would see, but part of that may just as well be due to fatigue and that year end holiday mode ;p. However, that should not discourage you to give it a bash anyways!</p>
