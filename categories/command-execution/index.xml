&lt;p>Recently I came across a few &lt;a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins&lt;/a> continuous integration servers. A relatively old version I might add but that fact was not important. What was important though was the fact that it was not configured to be &lt;em>&amp;lsquo;secure&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em>. Right out of the box Jenkins does not require any authentication to make use of it. In fact, it seems like its almost plug and play.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
