&lt;p&gt;The next post in the series of solving the &lt;a href=&#34;https://microcorruption.com&#34;&gt;microcorruption.com&lt;/a&gt; ctf challenges continues from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2018/03/03/microcorruption---tutorial/&#34;&gt;previous small tutorial challenge&lt;/a&gt; post. This challenge is titled &lt;em&gt;New Orleans&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These posts will detail my answers to solving various &lt;a href=&#34;https://microcorruption.com&#34;&gt;microcorruption.com&lt;/a&gt; ctf challenges. To begin, you should have at least had a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://microcorruption.com/manual.pdf&#34;&gt;lock manual&lt;/a&gt; for a number of helpful hints. These challenges are built to run on a MSP430 microcontroller unit, so if you need any assembly references, that is the architecture your are looking for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets look at the tutorial level first.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Its been a while since I have done a vulnerable boot2root from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/vulnhub&#34;&gt;@VulnHub&lt;/a&gt;. So, I decided to pick up where I last left. After paging back from the latest VM&amp;rsquo;s to where I roughly stopped last year, my attention was drawn to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/darknet-10,120/&#34;&gt;Darknet&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Q3rv0&#34;&gt;@Q3rv0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src=&#34;https://leonjza.github.io/images/darknet_logo.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is how I managed to solve a VM that totally kicked my ass! While I was solving this VM, I also tried out a Kali Docker image! This actually worked out great.

      <description>tl;dr Flick II just got published on Vulnhub! You should try it =)
introduction After about a year since Flick I, I have finally managed to get Flick II out to VulnHub. I learned a lot from Flick I and as a result applied it to Flick II. The making of Flick II was also a very different story. If I have to compare it to the first one (which took 3 nights to build start to finish), Flick II took waay longer.</description>

      <title>playing exploit-exercises - nebula</title>
      <link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/05/08/playing-exploit-exercises---nebula/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2015 07:18:31 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/05/08/playing-exploit-exercises---nebula/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I decided I wanted to have a look at what &lt;a href=&#34;https://exploit-exercises.com/&#34;&gt;Exploit Exercises&lt;/a&gt; had to offer. I was after the memory corruption related exploitation stuff to play with, until I saw the details for &lt;a href=&#34;https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/&#34;&gt;Nebula&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Nebula covers a variety of simple and intermediate challenges that cover Linux privilege escalation, common scripting language issues, and file system race conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://leonjza.github.io/images/nebula_logo.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I did not really have a lot of time on my hands and figured I should start with the &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; stuff. Many of the levels Nebula presented were in fact very, very easy. However, towards final levels my knowledge was definitely being tested. Levels started taking much longer to complete as I was yet again realizing that the more you learn, the more you realize you you still have to learn. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the path I took to solve the 20 challenges.

      <title>beating sokar the vulnhub turns 0b10 challenge</title>
      <link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/02/21/beating-sokar-the-vulnhub-turns-0b10-challenge/</link>

      <guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/02/21/beating-sokar-the-vulnhub-turns-0b10-challenge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/vulnhub-is-0b10.html&#34;&gt;Vulnhub is 0b10&lt;/a&gt; years old. That is binary for 2 :) In order to celebrate this, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse&#34;&gt;@_RastaMouse&lt;/a&gt;
 created &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sokar-1,113/&#34;&gt;Sokar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://leonjza.github.io/images/sokar_logo.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sokar was used as another writeup competition (the first for 2015), similar to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/09/18/from-persistence/&#34;&gt;Persistence&lt;/a&gt; challenge from Sep &amp;lsquo;14.
From the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/competition-sokar.html&#34;&gt;competition announcement blogpost&lt;/a&gt;, the rules of engagement were pretty familiar. Boot the VM, pwn it via the network and find the flag.
Of course, modifying the VM in order to help you get the flag (things like single user mode, rescue disks etc) are not allowed and you have to actually be able to prove how you got r00t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sokar frustrated me. A lot. However, almost all of the challenges and configurations of Sokar were plausible. Most of the vulnerabilities are valid in the sense that it may as well be out there in wild. So, it was a great learning experience once again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my entry for the competition. Enjoy! :)

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/pegasus-1,109/&#34;&gt;Pegasus 1&lt;/a&gt; is a boot2root hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vulnhub.com/&#34;&gt;VulnHub&lt;/a&gt; built by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/theknapsy&#34;&gt;@TheKnapsy&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;http://knapsy.github.io/blog/2014/12/16/pegasus-has-arrived-my-first-boot2root-vm/&#34;&gt;blogpost&lt;/a&gt; about it too containing a small introduction with Pegasus as his first boot2root (hoof2root? ;p).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://leonjza.github.io/images/pegasus_logo.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Having recently played in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/12/06/playing-in-the-playground-a-offsec-virtual-pentesting-labs-review/&#34;&gt;Offsec Playground&lt;/a&gt; a little after having completed my OSCP, I was relatively exhausted. Pegasus had its fair share of frustrations and had me digging around quite a bit. I did however learn a very valuable lesson&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;. You will see this in the &lt;strong&gt;my_first&lt;/strong&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other write ups I do, I will also recommend you try this one first before you read on. For me, Pegasus was definitely slightly more difficult than the usual VulnHub stuff you would see, but part of that may just as well be due to fatigue and that year end holiday mode ;p. However, that should not discourage you to give it a bash anyways!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets begin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vulnhub.com/entry/kvasir-i,106/&#34;&gt;Kvasir&lt;/a&gt;, a boot2root by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse&#34;&gt;@_RastaMouse&lt;/a&gt; has to be one of my most favorite boot2roots to date, if not the most favorite. Favorite however does not mean it was easy. It also proved to be one of the most challenging ones I have had the chance to try!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://leonjza.github.io/images/netcat.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Kvasir is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; well polished, and it can be seen throughout the VM that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse&#34;&gt;@_RastaMouse&lt;/a&gt; has gone through a lot of effort to make every challenge as rewarding as possible. From exploiting simple web based vulnerabilities to service misconfigurations, traffic sniffing, steganography, forensics and cryptopraphy, Kvasir has it all! Solving it also had me make really heavy use of good old netcat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This writeup details the path I took to read the final flag :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vulnhub.com/series/knock-knock,53/&#34;&gt;Knock-Knock&lt;/a&gt; is a vulnerable boot2root VM by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zer0w1re&#34;&gt;@zer0w1re&lt;/a&gt; and sure as heck was packed with interesting twists and things to learn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just &lt;em&gt;have a quick look™&lt;/em&gt;, and midnight that evening ended up with &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; privileges :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have not done this VM yet, this post is a massive spoiler and I would highly recommend you close up here and try it first :)
This is my experience &amp;lsquo;knocking&amp;rsquo; on the door.&lt;/p&gt;

Having been able to &lt;a href=&#34;https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/08/15/taming-the-troll/&#34;&gt;pwn Tr0ll1&lt;/a&gt;, I gave this one a shot too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;persist-we-must&#34;&gt;persist we must!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persistence! A new boot2root hosted &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/vulnhub&#34;&gt;@VulnHub&lt;/a&gt;, authored by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/superkojiman&#34;&gt;@superkojiman&lt;/a&gt; and sagi- definitely got the attention from the community it deserves! Persistence was actually part of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.vulnhub.com/2014/09/competition-persistence.html&#34;&gt;writeup competition&lt;/a&gt; launched on September the 7th, and ran up until October th 5th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my experience while trying to complete the challenge. Persistence, once again, challenged me to learn about things that would normally have me just go &amp;ldquo;meh, next&amp;rdquo;. As expected, this post is also a very big spoiler if you have not completed it yourself yet, so be warned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having recently started the road to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/&#34;&gt;OSCP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Maleus21&#34;&gt;@Maleus21&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;a href=&#34;http://vulnhub.com/entry/tr0ll-1,100/&#34;&gt;Tr0ll&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/VulnHub&#34;&gt;@VulnHub&lt;/a&gt;. I figured since the description was &lt;em&gt;Difficulty: Beginner ; Type: boot2root&lt;/em&gt;, I could give it a smash in a evening as a bit of distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xerxes2 is a successor in a boot2root series by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/barrebas&#34;&gt;@barrebas&lt;/a&gt; hosted by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/vulnhub&#34;&gt;@VulnHub&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t done it yet, close this article &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; and go learn by doing it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xerxes2, like most other boot2root type CTF&amp;rsquo;s, has once again forced me to learn a whole lot more than I thought possible. In total it took me about 3 or 4 days on and off to complete. The goal was as usual, read &lt;code&gt;/root/flag.txt&lt;/code&gt;. This is the path I took to read the flag and gain root command execution. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a CTF! You should try it! Find it &lt;a href=&#34;http://vulnhub.com/entry/flick-1,99/&#34;&gt;on Vulnhub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword&#34;&gt;foreword&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, security CTF&amp;rsquo;s are fun. A lot of fun. And can be one heck of a time sink! Checking my laptops time and realizing its 3am on a week night is normal when I get pulled into one. The frustration, the trolls, the tremendous amounts of learning is all part of the experience of a successful CTF in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;##foreword
Lets start by saying that this is probably one of the toughest boot2root&amp;rsquo;s I have tried thus far. Even though I have managed to get &lt;code&gt;/root/flag.txt&lt;/code&gt;, I am yet to actually &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; this beast. I believe I have arguably come quite far and there is only one hurdle left, however, almost 3 days later I have learnt a &lt;strong&gt;TON&lt;/strong&gt; of stuff, and am satisfied to start jotting the experience down. Obviously, should I finally get &lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ll update here and reflect. This is also a relatively long post as there were a ton of things to do. Give yourself some time if you plan on reading the whole post :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, at a local Security Conference, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/telspacesystems&#34;&gt;@telspacesystems&lt;/a&gt; ran a CTF. It was a classic &amp;lsquo;read /root/flag.txt&amp;rsquo; CTF hosted on a wireless network. Sadly the wifi sucked, a lot, and due to this and a flat battery I was not able to attempt this CTF properly at the con. Nonetheless, the VM was released on &lt;a href=&#34;http://vulnhub.com/entry/skytower-1,96/&#34;&gt;VulnHub&lt;/a&gt;, and was promptly downloaded and loaded into VirtualBox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, this CTF taught me some interesting things about SQL injection where filters are present. More specifically, commas were filtered out and resulted in the need from some creative thinking :)&lt;/p&gt;
