&lt;p>As I am writing this post, it&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;morning after&amp;rdquo; I have received the much awaited email confirming that I have successfully completed the OSCP Certification requirements!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to obtain OSCP Certification, one must complete some time in the Penetration Testing with Kali Linux labs followed by a grueling 24 hour exam challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One really big realization that I came to was the fact that one should not attempt to do this if your goal is simply to get the OSCP Certification. Doing PWK is a excellent opportunity to learn and rushing it may cause you to not make it in the exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below is a summary of my experience obtaining OSCP.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
