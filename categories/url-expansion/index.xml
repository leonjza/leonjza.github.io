      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-there-is-a-good-use&#34;&gt;So there is a good use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URL Shorteners, as they are most commonly known, are pretty useful in places where you are limited to the amount of characters you are allowed to type. Twitter being the prime example. However, it is not only because of services like that that these URL shortening services exist. Sometimes, URL&amp;rsquo;s are are just plain crazy long, and very error prone when you have to copy and paste/link them someone. I guess we can call this a useful feature?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
