&lt;p>Recently at a conference that I attended, I sat in a class that was talking about Botnets and general &amp;lsquo;How Easy They Are&amp;rsquo; related things. 90% of the technical discussions did not really come as a surprise to me, however, I came to realize that I am not &lt;strong>100%&lt;/strong> aware of how ( and I dare say this lightly ) &lt;em>easy&lt;/em> they have it. The technical competency of the adversary really doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be at a jaw droppingly high level. In fact, if you can operate the keyboard and mouse, heck, even a tablet/phone once its all setup, then you could potentially be a successful botnet operator.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
