      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE! THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. CHANCES ARE, IF YOU TRY THIS WITHOUT PERMISSION, YOU WILL GET CAUGHT AND GET THROWN INTO A DARK PLACE WITH NO INTERNET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bots-for-the-masses&#34;&gt;Bots for the masses.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently at a conference that I attended, I sat in a class that was talking about Botnets and general &amp;lsquo;How Easy They Are&amp;rsquo; related things. 90% of the technical discussions did not really come as a surprise to me, however, I came to realize that I am not &lt;strong&gt;100%&lt;/strong&gt; aware of how ( and I dare say this lightly ) &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; they have it. The technical competency of the adversary really doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be at a jaw droppingly high level. In fact, if you can operate the keyboard and mouse, heck, even a tablet/phone once its all setup, then you could potentially be a successful botnet operator.&lt;/p&gt;
