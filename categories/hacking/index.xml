      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I want to talk a little about the BSides Cape Town 2017 RFCat challenge and how I went about trying to build a challenge for it. Unfortunately I was not able to able to attend the conference itself, but still had the privilege to contribute in some way!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-index.html&#34;&gt;defcon24&lt;/a&gt; this year, I impulsively bought myself some new toys. Amongst what I got included a &lt;a href=&#34;https://greatscottgadgets.com/yardstickone/&#34;&gt;YARD Stick One&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://greatscottgadgets.com/ubertoothone/&#34;&gt;Ubertooth One&lt;/a&gt;. I already owned a DVB-T dongle much like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Digital-DVB-T-RTL2832U-FC0013B-Receiver/dp/B00NOP0P6W&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; that I bought at defcon23 the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interest in Software Defined Radio has long been one of those where I just felt so overwhelmed with the idea for a very long time that I dare not try it. This, together with the fact that its something I &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt;  know nothing about really did make for this bit of research to be pretty daunting at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, here is my adventure into reverse engineering a plain static key remote and successfully replaying it from my computer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
