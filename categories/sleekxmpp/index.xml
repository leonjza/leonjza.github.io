&lt;p>Well, to be honest, I am not really sure of many use cases for this, however maybe someone, somewhere will need to do something like this, and I would have done my deed and saved someone some time ::sun::&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sleekxmpp.com/">SleekXMPP&lt;/a> is a python XMPP framework. It takes a bit to get your head around it, but once you have some basics covered its quite a rewarding library to work with. :) To start, you need to install 2 dependencies. Python Mailer and SleekXMPP itself. Something like &lt;code>pip install mailer sleekxmpp&lt;/code> or for the older school, &lt;code>easy_install sleekxmpp mailer&lt;/code> should do the trick. It can&amp;rsquo;t hurt to check if the distro you use has these are packages already too.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
