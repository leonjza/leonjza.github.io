&lt;h2 id="introduction">introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Recently I decided I wanted to have a look at what &lt;a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/">Exploit Exercises&lt;/a> had to offer. I was after the memory corruption related exploitation stuff to play with, until I saw the details for &lt;a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/">Nebula&lt;/a>. &lt;em>Nebula covers a variety of simple and intermediate challenges that cover Linux privilege escalation, common scripting language issues, and file system race conditions.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I did not really have a lot of time on my hands and figured I should start with the &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; stuff. Many of the levels Nebula presented were in fact very, very easy. However, towards final levels my knowledge was definitely being tested. Levels started taking much longer to complete as I was yet again realizing that the more you learn, the more you realize you you still have to learn. :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the path I took to solve the 20 challenges.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
