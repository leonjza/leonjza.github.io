      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I decided I wanted to have a look at what &lt;a href=&#34;https://exploit-exercises.com/&#34;&gt;Exploit Exercises&lt;/a&gt; had to offer. I was after the memory corruption related exploitation stuff to play with, until I saw the details for &lt;a href=&#34;https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/&#34;&gt;Nebula&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Nebula covers a variety of simple and intermediate challenges that cover Linux privilege escalation, common scripting language issues, and file system race conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not really have a lot of time on my hands and figured I should start with the &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; stuff. Many of the levels Nebula presented were in fact very, very easy. However, towards final levels my knowledge was definitely being tested. Levels started taking much longer to complete as I was yet again realizing that the more you learn, the more you realize you you still have to learn. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the path I took to solve the 20 challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
