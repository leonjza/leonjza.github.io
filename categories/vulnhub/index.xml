&lt;p>Its been a while since I have done a vulnerable boot2root from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vulnhub">@VulnHub&lt;/a>. So, I decided to pick up where I last left. After paging back from the latest VM&amp;rsquo;s to where I roughly stopped last year, my attention was drawn to &lt;a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/darknet-10,120/">Darknet&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Q3rv0">@Q3rv0&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This is how I managed to solve a VM that totally kicked my ass! While I was solving this VM, I also tried out a Kali Docker image! This actually worked out great.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>beating sokar the vulnhub turns 0b10 challenge</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/02/21/beating-sokar-the-vulnhub-turns-0b10-challenge/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2015 15:55:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/02/21/beating-sokar-the-vulnhub-turns-0b10-challenge/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/vulnhub-is-0b10.html">Vulnhub is 0b10&lt;/a> years old. That is binary for 2 :) In order to celebrate this, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse">@_RastaMouse&lt;/a>
created &lt;a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sokar-1,113/">Sokar&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="left" >
&lt;img src="https://leonjza.github.io/images/sokar_logo.png" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Sokar was used as another writeup competition (the first for 2015), similar to the &lt;a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/09/18/from-persistence/">Persistence&lt;/a> challenge from Sep &amp;lsquo;14.
From the &lt;a href="http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/competition-sokar.html">competition announcement blogpost&lt;/a>, the rules of engagement were pretty familiar. Boot the VM, pwn it via the network and find the flag.
Of course, modifying the VM in order to help you get the flag (things like single user mode, rescue disks etc) are not allowed and you have to actually be able to prove how you got r00t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sokar frustrated me. A lot. However, almost all of the challenges and configurations of Sokar were plausible. Most of the vulnerabilities are valid in the sense that it may as well be out there in wild. So, it was a great learning experience once again!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is my entry for the competition. Enjoy! :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>hoof to root solving pegasus 1</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/12/23/hoof-to-root-solving-pegasus-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2014 08:29:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/12/23/hoof-to-root-solving-pegasus-1/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/pegasus-1,109/">Pegasus 1&lt;/a> is a boot2root hosted on &lt;a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">VulnHub&lt;/a> built by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theknapsy">@TheKnapsy&lt;/a>. He wrote a &lt;a href="http://knapsy.github.io/blog/2014/12/16/pegasus-has-arrived-my-first-boot2root-vm/">blogpost&lt;/a> about it too containing a small introduction with Pegasus as his first boot2root (hoof2root? ;p).&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="left" >
&lt;img src="https://leonjza.github.io/images/pegasus_logo.png" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Having recently played in the &lt;a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/12/06/playing-in-the-playground-a-offsec-virtual-pentesting-labs-review/">Offsec Playground&lt;/a> a little after having completed my OSCP, I was relatively exhausted. Pegasus had its fair share of frustrations and had me digging around quite a bit. I did however learn a very valuable lesson&amp;hellip; &lt;em>again&lt;/em>. You will see this in the &lt;strong>my_first&lt;/strong> section.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like many other write ups I do, I will also recommend you try this one first before you read on. For me, Pegasus was definitely slightly more difficult than the usual VulnHub stuff you would see, but part of that may just as well be due to fatigue and that year end holiday mode ;p. However, that should not discourage you to give it a bash anyways!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets begin.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>solving kvasir netcat edition</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/11/09/solving-kvasir-netcat-edition/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2014 10:27:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/11/09/solving-kvasir-netcat-edition/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://vulnhub.com/entry/kvasir-i,106/">Kvasir&lt;/a>, a boot2root by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse">@_RastaMouse&lt;/a> has to be one of my most favorite boot2roots to date, if not the most favorite. Favorite however does not mean it was easy. It also proved to be one of the most challenging ones I have had the chance to try!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="left" >
&lt;img src="https://leonjza.github.io/images/netcat.png" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Kvasir is &lt;em>extremely&lt;/em> well polished, and it can be seen throughout the VM that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse">@_RastaMouse&lt;/a> has gone through a lot of effort to make every challenge as rewarding as possible. From exploiting simple web based vulnerabilities to service misconfigurations, traffic sniffing, steganography, forensics and cryptopraphy, Kvasir has it all! Solving it also had me make really heavy use of good old netcat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This writeup details the path I took to read the final flag :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>knock-knock who’s there? solving knock knock</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/10/14/knock-knock-whos-there-solving-knock-knock/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2014 09:14:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/10/14/knock-knock-whos-there-solving-knock-knock/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://vulnhub.com/series/knock-knock,53/">Knock-Knock&lt;/a> is a vulnerable boot2root VM by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zer0w1re">@zer0w1re&lt;/a> and sure as heck was packed with interesting twists and things to learn!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just &lt;em>have a quick look™&lt;/em>, and midnight that evening ended up with &lt;em>root&lt;/em> privileges :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always, if you have not done this VM yet, this post is a massive spoiler and I would highly recommend you close up here and try it first :)
This is my experience &amp;lsquo;knocking&amp;rsquo; on the door.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>another troll tamed solving troll 2</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/10/10/another-troll-tamed-solving-troll-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2014 17:32:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/10/10/another-troll-tamed-solving-troll-2/</guid><description>

&lt;h2 id="persist-we-must">persist we must!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Persistence! A new boot2root hosted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vulnhub">@VulnHub&lt;/a>, authored by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/superkojiman">@superkojiman&lt;/a> and sagi- definitely got the attention from the community it deserves! Persistence was actually part of a &lt;a href="http://blog.vulnhub.com/2014/09/competition-persistence.html">writeup competition&lt;/a> launched on September the 7th, and ran up until October th 5th.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my experience while trying to complete the challenge. Persistence, once again, challenged me to learn about things that would normally have me just go &amp;ldquo;meh, next&amp;rdquo;. As expected, this post is also a very big spoiler if you have not completed it yourself yet, so be warned!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>taming the troll</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/08/15/taming-the-troll/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2014 07:12:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/08/15/taming-the-troll/</guid><description>

&lt;h2 id="foreword">foreword&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Xerxes2 is a successor in a boot2root series by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/barrebas">@barrebas&lt;/a> hosted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vulnhub">@VulnHub&lt;/a>. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t done it yet, close this article &lt;em>now&lt;/em> and go learn by doing it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Xerxes2, like most other boot2root type CTF&amp;rsquo;s, has once again forced me to learn a whole lot more than I thought possible. In total it took me about 3 or 4 days on and off to complete. The goal was as usual, read &lt;code>/root/flag.txt&lt;/code>. This is the path I took to read the flag and gain root command execution. Enjoy!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
