&lt;p>Recently at a conference that I attended, I sat in a class that was talking about Botnets and general &amp;lsquo;How Easy They Are&amp;rsquo; related things. 90% of the technical discussions did not really come as a surprise to me, however, I came to realize that I am not &lt;strong>100%&lt;/strong> aware of how ( and I dare say this lightly ) &lt;em>easy&lt;/em> they have it. The technical competency of the adversary really doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be at a jaw droppingly high level. In fact, if you can operate the keyboard and mouse, heck, even a tablet/phone once its all setup, then you could potentially be a successful botnet operator.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jabber to Email using SleekXMPP</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/06/07/jabber-to-email-using-sleekxmpp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/06/07/jabber-to-email-using-sleekxmpp/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Well, to be honest, I am not really sure of many use cases for this, however maybe someone, somewhere will need to do something like this, and I would have done my deed and saved someone some time ::sun::&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="introducing-sleekxmpp">Introducing SleekXMPP&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sleekxmpp.com/">SleekXMPP&lt;/a> is a python XMPP framework. It takes a bit to get your head around it, but once you have some basics covered its quite a rewarding library to work with. :) To start, you need to install 2 dependencies. Python Mailer and SleekXMPP itself. Something like &lt;code>pip install mailer sleekxmpp&lt;/code> or for the older school, &lt;code>easy_install sleekxmpp mailer&lt;/code> should do the trick. It can&amp;rsquo;t hurt to check if the distro you use has these are packages already too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To: Extremely simple python Jabber Broadcast Bot</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/05/25/how-to-extremely-simple-python-jabber-broadcast-bot/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/05/25/how-to-extremely-simple-python-jabber-broadcast-bot/</guid><description>
&lt;h3 id="bots-bots-bots">Bots! Bots! Bots!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Generally speaking, a &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;bot&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; is something that like &lt;em>does work for you&lt;/em>. But, for this purpose, the need for a jabber bot came from the fact that I had to deal with a lot of email on a daily basis. This large amount of mail sometimes would cause me to completely miss critical mail alerts. Realising later that I could have prevented a catastrophe if I didn&amp;rsquo;t miss that &lt;strong>one&lt;/strong> email was just not on anymore. So, I started investigating ways to get the &lt;em>important&lt;/em> stuff delivered faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a team at work, we have long gone dropped the whole Skype group chat thing for our own Jabber server. My privacy related concerns back then was recently heightened &lt;a href="http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/2013-May/004224.html">here&lt;/a> when a trap URL received a HEAD request from &lt;strong>65.52.100.214&lt;/strong>. The user that received the URL in a chat was under strict instructions not to actually click it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
