&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to introduce you to a toolkit that I have been working on, called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sensepost/objection&#34;&gt;objection&lt;/a&gt;. The name being a play on the words &amp;ldquo;object&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;injection&amp;rdquo;. objection is a runtime exploration toolkit powered by Frida, aimed at mobile platforms. objection aims to allow you to perform various security related tasks on unencrypted iOS applications, at runtime, on non-jailbroken iOS devices as well as Android applications on Android devices. Features include inspecting the application specific keychain, as well as inspecting various artifacts left on disk during (or after) execution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
