      <description>foreword DawgCTF 20201 was the first CTF I played together with some local people much smarter than me over at Hack South. We managed to grab 28th place too.
 I only solved three challenges with the time I had in the morning (of which one was a dupe because reading is hard :P).
solutions reversing - calculator  Category: Reversing Points: 50 Files: Windows PE  This was the duplicate challenge, but I&amp;rsquo;m writing up how I did it anyways.</description>

      <description>foreword The HTB Cyber Apocalypse 2021 event was a nice and polished CTF. Apart from the usual start time load issues, everything ran pretty smoothly with nearly zero issues my side. Kudo&amp;rsquo;s HTB! Here are the solutions for the ~20 challenges I managed to solve.
