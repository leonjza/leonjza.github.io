      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, I toyed with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/02/09/no-more-jailbreak-detection-an-adventure-into-android-app-reversing-and-smali-patching/&#34;&gt;Android root detection bypass&lt;/a&gt;. In a similar scenario, I was poking at a iOS application that also had some root detection built in. For very much the same purpose, I suppose the application has its own ~reasons~ for the jailbreak detection. Of course, this makes the testing I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; wanted to do impossible as I&amp;rsquo;d very much like to dig under the hood :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, its was time to try and bypass the jailbreak detection of the application.
All I had to work with was a &lt;code&gt;.ipa&lt;/code&gt;. Similar to the android &lt;code&gt;.apk&lt;/code&gt; file, the &lt;code&gt;.ipa&lt;/code&gt; is also just a zipped up archive of the actual application files. To test with, I had a iPad mini. The iPad was running the latest iOS (8.1.2 at the time of this post) and was also jailbroken. If I remember correctly the jailbreak tool used was called TaiG. Anyways, inside the applications &lt;code&gt;.ipa&lt;/code&gt; archive was a whole bunch of resource files and what not, including the compiled application executable. This executable is what is of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will start by saying that I am by &lt;em&gt;no means&lt;/em&gt; a expert in anything you are about to read. I am also not 100% sure about the correct terminology for this type of patching. Maybe it should have been called binary patching? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but I do know that I was quite literally shocked by the ease of getting this job done, and figured its time to make some notes for me to reflect on later again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I had the opportunity to poke at an Android &lt;code&gt;.apk&lt;/code&gt;. My task was a little different from what I am about to blog about, but the fundamental idea remained the same. I wanted to inspect some traffic of an application, but the application had jailbreak detection built in and refused to run if the device its running on is detected as jailbroken. This had to be bypassed first. To play with the &lt;code&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt;, I needed to get some tools setup and learn a few things about the Android environment &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fast. There are tons of resources available online to describe to you the general idea behind Android, as well as how its all stitched together. You will quickly come to realize that apps can be written in Java. For the purpose of this post, the focus is to bypass the jailbreak detection the &lt;code&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; had and let it continue normal operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
