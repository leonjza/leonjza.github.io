&lt;p>A silly reverse shell invoked via the Composer Dependency Manager. &lt;a href="https://github.com/leonjza/composer-shell">Source here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer&lt;/a>, which is most probably &lt;em>the&lt;/em> most popular PHP dependency manager allows for &lt;a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md">scripts&lt;/a> to run as callbacks on based an event.
Callbacks are normally triggered just before or after certain events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is possible to provide shell commands to the &lt;code>scripts&lt;/code> property in the required &lt;code>composer.json&lt;/code> file (with a few restrictions), but this method echoes the command that it executes.
A slightly more covert approach would be to execute a cleverly named static function in a class included in the codebase. It has to be one that can be autoloaded by composer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quick Win: Quickly Execute Last Shell Command</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/06/23/quick-win-quickly-execute-last-shell-command/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/06/23/quick-win-quickly-execute-last-shell-command/</guid><description>
Work clever, not hard This will be the first post of a series of quick shell tips for getting things done, fast. Infact, it will probably just serve as a notepad for me on the topic ;)
Last shell command If you are using a shell, such as Bash, which is pretty much the default on most Linux distributions, then you probably know that you can just use the up arrow to get the last command.</description></item></channel></rss>
