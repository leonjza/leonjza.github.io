&lt;p>Active Directory is almost always in scope for many pentests. There is sometimes a competitive nature amongst pentesters where the challenge is to see who can set a new record for gaining Domain Administrative privileges the fastest. How sad its that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reality is, &lt;em>many&lt;/em> times, the escalation processes is trivial. Pwn some workstation with admin creds, grab credentials out of &lt;code>lsass&lt;/code> and pass the hash to move around laterally. This has been the typical breakfast of many pentesters. Heck, there are even attempts to &lt;a href="https://github.com/sensepost/autoDANE">automate&lt;/a> this type of process because, personally, I feel its getting pretty old. Yet, its still very viable as an attack method due to its high success rate!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post however tries to look at it from a little fresher perspective. There are many posts like this out there, but this one is mine. Mostly just a brain dump that I can refer to later. Many others have written this up (maybe even in greater detail), so definitely have a look around!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
