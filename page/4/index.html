<p>Towards the end of last year, I found myself <a href=https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2016/10/02/reverse-engineering-static-key-remotes-with-gnuradio-and-rfcat/>playing around</a> with some basic AM/OOK SDR stuff™. That resulted in <a href=https://github.com/leonjza/ooktools>ooktools</a> being built to help with making some of that work easier and to help me learn. A few days ago, metasploit announced new <a href=https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2017/03/21/metasploits-rf-transceiver-capabilities>&lsquo;rftransceiver&rsquo; capabilities</a> that were added to the framework with a similar goal of making this research easier.</p>

<p>In a <a href=https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2016/10/02/reverse-engineering-static-key-remotes-with-gnuradio-and-rfcat/>previous post</a>, I spoke about a simple static key remote and how to replicate its signal using a small python script and RfCat. As part of the work done there, I set out to write a small tool that should help with some of the tasks involved with this process.</p>

<p>At <a href=https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-index.html>defcon24</a> this year, I impulsively bought myself some new toys. Amongst what I got included a <a href=https://greatscottgadgets.com/yardstickone/>YARD Stick One</a> and a <a href=https://greatscottgadgets.com/ubertoothone/>Ubertooth One</a>. I already owned a DVB-T dongle much like <a href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Digital-DVB-T-RTL2832U-FC0013B-Receiver/dp/B00NOP0P6W>this one</a> that I bought at defcon23 the previous year.</p>
<p>My interest in Software Defined Radio has long been one of those where I just felt so overwhelmed with the idea for a very long time that I dare not try it. This, together with the fact that its something I <em>totally</em> know nothing about really did make for this bit of research to be pretty daunting at first.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, here is my adventure into reverse engineering a plain static key remote and successfully replaying it from my computer.</p>

<p>Nmap&rsquo;s greppable output is really handy. Saving greppable output from a scan means the output is delimited in a way that can be easily processed using tools such as <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>awk</code>.</p>
<figure class=left>

<p>This post shows a few examples of post scan processing of the greppable output produced with the <code>-oG</code> flag. A more up to date repository with examples and command explanations can be found in my <a href=https://github.com/leonjza/awesome-nmap-grep>awesome-nmap-grep</a> github repository.</p>

<p>Its been a while since I have done a vulnerable boot2root from <a href=https://twitter.com/vulnhub>@VulnHub</a>. So, I decided to pick up where I last left. After paging back from the latest VM&rsquo;s to where I roughly stopped last year, my attention was drawn to <a href=https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/darknet-10,120/>Darknet</a> by <a href=https://twitter.com/Q3rv0>@Q3rv0</a>.</p>

<p>Active Directory is almost always in scope for many pentests. There is sometimes a competitive nature amongst pentesters where the challenge is to see who can set a new record for gaining Domain Administrative privileges the fastest. How sad its that?</p>
<p>The reality is, <em>many</em> times, the escalation processes is trivial. Pwn some workstation with admin creds, grab credentials out of <code>lsass</code> and pass the hash to move around laterally. This has been the typical breakfast of many pentesters. Heck, there are even attempts to <a href=https://github.com/sensepost/autoDANE>automate</a> this type of process because, personally, I feel its getting pretty old. Yet, its still very viable as an attack method due to its high success rate!</p>
<p>This post however tries to look at it from a little fresher perspective. There are many posts like this out there, but this one is mine. Mostly just a brain dump that I can refer to later. Many others have written this up (maybe even in greater detail), so definitely have a look around!</p>

<p>A silly reverse shell invoked via the Composer Dependency Manager. <a href=https://github.com/leonjza/composer-shell>Source here</a></p>
<p><a href=https://getcomposer.org/>Composer</a>, which is most probably <em>the</em> most popular PHP dependency manager allows for <a href=https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md>scripts</a> to run as callbacks on based an event.
Callbacks are normally triggered just before or after certain events.</p>
<p>It is possible to provide shell commands to the <code>scripts</code> property in the required <code>composer.json</code> file (with a few restrictions), but this method echoes the command that it executes.
A slightly more covert approach would be to execute a cleverly named static function in a class included in the codebase. It has to be one that can be autoloaded by composer.</p>

<p>Recently I became aware of the <a href=http://canarytokens.org>canarytokens</a> project by the guys over at <a href=http://thinkst.com/>Thinkst</a>. The basic idea is to manipulate things like documents / services in such a way that usage thereof will trigger an alert via some form of &lsquo;phone home&rsquo; feature. The is most probably better known as &lsquo;honeydocs&rsquo;. In the case of <a href=http://canarytokens.org>canarytokens</a>, the phone home features can be either via a DNS or HTTP request coupled with a unique token. As paraphrased from the projects website, this is no new groundbreaking idea but just another usable one.</p>
<p>In this post, I just want to take a few moments and jot down my findings when investigating the documents generated by this project.</p>

tl;dr Flick II just got published on Vulnhub! You should try it =)
introduction After about a year since Flick I, I have finally managed to get Flick II out to VulnHub. I learned a lot from Flick I and as a result applied it to Flick II. The making of Flick II was also a very different story. If I have to compare it to the first one (which took 3 nights to build start to finish), Flick II took waay longer.

<p>Recently I came across a few <a href=https://jenkins-ci.org/>Jenkins</a> continuous integration servers. A relatively old version I might add but that fact was not important. What was important though was the fact that it was not configured to be <em>&lsquo;secure&rsquo;</em>. Right out of the box Jenkins does not require any authentication to make use of it. In fact, it seems like its almost plug and play.</p>
