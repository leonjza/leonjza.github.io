<p><a href=http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/vulnhub-is-0b10.html>Vulnhub is 0b10</a> years old. That is binary for 2 :) In order to celebrate this, <a href=https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse>@_RastaMouse</a>
created <a href=https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sokar-1,113/>Sokar</a>.</p>
<figure class=left>
<img src=/images/sokar_logo.png>
</figure>
<p>Sokar was used as another writeup competition (the first for 2015), similar to the <a href=https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/09/18/from-persistence/>Persistence</a> challenge from Sep &lsquo;14.
From the <a href=http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/competition-sokar.html>competition announcement blogpost</a>, the rules of engagement were pretty familiar. Boot the VM, pwn it via the network and find the flag.
Of course, modifying the VM in order to help you get the flag (things like single user mode, rescue disks etc) are not allowed and you have to actually be able to prove how you got r00t.</p>
<p>Sokar frustrated me. A lot. However, almost all of the challenges and configurations of Sokar were plausible. Most of the vulnerabilities are valid in the sense that it may as well be out there in wild. So, it was a great learning experience once again!</p>
<p>Here is my entry for the competition. Enjoy! :)</p>

<h2 id=introduction>introduction</h2>
<p>Not too long ago, I toyed with a <a href=https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/02/09/no-more-jailbreak-detection-an-adventure-into-android-app-reversing-and-smali-patching/>Android root detection bypass</a>. In a similar scenario, I was poking at a iOS application that also had some root detection built in. For very much the same purpose, I suppose the application has its own ~reasons~ for the jailbreak detection. Of course, this makes the testing I <em>actually</em> wanted to do impossible as I&rsquo;d very much like to dig under the hood :)</p>
<figure class=left>
<img src=/images/ios_jailbreak_logo.png>
</figure>
<p>So, its was time to try and bypass the jailbreak detection of the application.
All I had to work with was a <code>.ipa</code>. Similar to the android <code>.apk</code> file, the <code>.ipa</code> is also just a zipped up archive of the actual application files. To test with, I had a iPad mini. The iPad was running the latest iOS (8.1.2 at the time of this post) and was also jailbroken. If I remember correctly the jailbreak tool used was called TaiG. Anyways, inside the applications <code>.ipa</code> archive was a whole bunch of resource files and what not, including the compiled application executable. This executable is what is of interest.</p>

<p>I will start by saying that I am by <em>no means</em> a expert in anything you are about to read. I am also not 100% sure about the correct terminology for this type of patching. Maybe it should have been called binary patching? I don&rsquo;t know, but I do know that I was quite literally shocked by the ease of getting this job done, and figured its time to make some notes for me to reflect on later again.</p>
<figure class=left>
<img src=/images/android_jailbreak_logo.png>
</figure>
<p>Recently I had the opportunity to poke at an Android <code>.apk</code>. My task was a little different from what I am about to blog about, but the fundamental idea remained the same. I wanted to inspect some traffic of an application, but the application had jailbreak detection built in and refused to run if the device its running on is detected as jailbroken. This had to be bypassed first. To play with the <code>apk</code>, I needed to get some tools setup and learn a few things about the Android environment <em>really</em> fast. There are tons of resources available online to describe to you the general idea behind Android, as well as how its all stitched together. You will quickly come to realize that apps can be written in Java. For the purpose of this post, the focus is to bypass the jailbreak detection the <code>apk</code> had and let it continue normal operations.</p>

<p>Having recently played in the <a href=https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/12/06/playing-in-the-playground-a-offsec-virtual-pentesting-labs-review/>Offsec Playground</a> a little after having completed my OSCP, I was relatively exhausted. Pegasus had its fair share of frustrations and had me digging around quite a bit. I did however learn a very valuable lesson&mldr; <em>again</em>. You will see this in the <strong>my_first</strong> section.</p>
<p>Like many other write ups I do, I will also recommend you try this one first before you read on. For me, Pegasus was definitely slightly more difficult than the usual VulnHub stuff you would see, but part of that may just as well be due to fatigue and that year end holiday mode ;p. However, that should not discourage you to give it a bash anyways!</p>

<p>As you may know, I recently completed the Penetration testing with Kali Linux training and obtained OSCP certification. It was an amazing experience and really taught me more than just <em>&ldquo;hacking stuff&rdquo;</em>. Instead, the training came coupled with self discipline and endurance. By day I make a living in the IT security field, by night, I tinker, research and learn!</p>
<p>With PWK over, not long after that, I was privileged enough to be presented with a opportunity to beta test a new product that <a href=http://www.offensive-security.com/>Offensive Security</a> is planning to launch around January 2015 referred to as&mldr;</p>

<p>As I am writing this post, it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;morning after&rdquo; I have received the much awaited email confirming that I have successfully completed the OSCP Certification requirements!</p>
<p>In order to obtain OSCP Certification, one must complete some time in the Penetration Testing with Kali Linux labs followed by a grueling 24 hour exam challenge.</p>
<p>One really big realization that I came to was the fact that one should not attempt to do this if your goal is simply to get the OSCP Certification. Doing PWK is a excellent opportunity to learn and rushing it may cause you to not make it in the exam.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of my experience obtaining OSCP.</p>

<p><a href=http://vulnhub.com/entry/kvasir-i,106/>Kvasir</a>, a boot2root by <a href=https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse>@_RastaMouse</a> has to be one of my most favorite boot2roots to date, if not the most favorite. Favorite however does not mean it was easy. It also proved to be one of the most challenging ones I have had the chance to try!</p>
<figure class=left>
<img src=/images/netcat.png>

<p>Kvasir is <em>extremely</em> well polished, and it can be seen throughout the VM that <a href=https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse>@_RastaMouse</a> has gone through a lot of effort to make every challenge as rewarding as possible. From exploiting simple web based vulnerabilities to service misconfigurations, traffic sniffing, steganography, forensics and cryptopraphy, Kvasir has it all! Solving it also had me make really heavy use of good old netcat.</p>
<p>This writeup details the path I took to read the final flag :)</p>

<p>Persistence! A new boot2root hosted <a href=https://twitter.com/vulnhub>@VulnHub</a>, authored by <a href=https://twitter.com/superkojiman>@superkojiman</a> and sagi- definitely got the attention from the community it deserves! Persistence was actually part of a <a href=http://blog.vulnhub.com/2014/09/competition-persistence.html>writeup competition</a> launched on September the 7th, and ran up until October th 5th.</p>
<p>This is my experience while trying to complete the challenge. Persistence, once again, challenged me to learn about things that would normally have me just go &ldquo;meh, next&rdquo;. As expected, this post is also a very big spoiler if you have not completed it yourself yet, so be warned!</p>
