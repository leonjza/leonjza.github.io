<p><strong>EDIT</strong> This guide has been updated to accomodate a few changes (see <a href=https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/issues/5422>here</a>)</p>
<p>Recently I have had to get Oracle support sorted in my Kali Linux install. I will try not to rant about the reasons why it doesn&rsquo;t just work out of the box and just get the steps written down quickly. Typically, when you try to use a module such as <code>oracle_login</code>, metasploit may error out with:</p>

<p>Xerxes2 is a successor in a boot2root series by <a href=https://twitter.com/barrebas>@barrebas</a> hosted by <a href=https://twitter.com/vulnhub>@VulnHub</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t done it yet, close this article <em>now</em> and go learn by doing it!</p>
<p>Xerxes2, like most other boot2root type CTF&rsquo;s, has once again forced me to learn a whole lot more than I thought possible. In total it took me about 3 or 4 days on and off to complete. The goal was as usual, read <code>/root/flag.txt</code>. This is the path I took to read the flag and gain root command execution. Enjoy!</p>

<p>So, security CTF&rsquo;s are fun. A lot of fun. And can be one heck of a time sink! Checking my laptops time and realizing its 3am on a week night is normal when I get pulled into one. The frustration, the trolls, the tremendous amounts of learning is all part of the experience of a successful CTF in my opinion.</p>

Lets start by saying that this is probably one of the toughest boot2root&rsquo;s I have tried thus far. Even though I have managed to get <code>/root/flag.txt</code>, I am yet to actually <em>root</em> this beast. I believe I have arguably come quite far and there is only one hurdle left, however, almost 3 days later I have learnt a <strong>TON</strong> of stuff, and am satisfied to start jotting the experience down. Obviously, should I finally get <strong>root</strong>, I&rsquo;ll update here and reflect. This is also a relatively long post as there were a ton of things to do. Give yourself some time if you plan on reading the whole post :)</p>

<p>Recently, at a local Security Conference, <a href=https://twitter.com/telspacesystems>@telspacesystems</a> ran a CTF. It was a classic &lsquo;read /root/flag.txt&rsquo; CTF hosted on a wireless network. Sadly the wifi sucked, a lot, and due to this and a flat battery I was not able to attempt this CTF properly at the con. Nonetheless, the VM was released on <a href=http://vulnhub.com/entry/skytower-1,96/>VulnHub</a>, and was promptly downloaded and loaded into VirtualBox.</p>
<p>In summary, this CTF taught me some interesting things about SQL injection where filters are present. More specifically, commas were filtered out and resulted in the need from some creative thinking :)</p>

<p>This is not a old technique. Many a person has written about it and many technical methods are available to achieve this. Most notably, a concept of getting TCP type connectivity over DNS tunnels is probably a better idea to opt for should you wish to actually use technology like this. A quick Google even revealed full blown dns-tunneling-as-a-service type offers.</p>
<h3 id=this-article-is-not>this article is not&mldr;</h3>
<p>&mldr; about anything particularly new. It is simply my ramblings, and some python code slapped together in literally a day in order for me to learn and get my hands dirty with the concepts.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this post, this VM was part of a local security communities (<a href=http://zacon.org.za/>zacon</a>) pre-con challenge. Finding /root/flag.txt would have entered you into a draw for winning a prize :D However, the greater goal of the challenge was to learn something. I set out some time and attempted the challenge. Fortunately, I managed to complete it in time. So, this is the journey I took to solve this. You can now download and try this VM yourself over at <a href=http://vulnhub.com/entry/devrandom_relativity,55/>VulnHub</a>. Unzip, mount and boot the VM. Once the VM is booted, it should have an IP assigned via DHCP.</p>
<p>I think it is interesting to note that I used a very limited set of tools to complete this. No bruteforcers, metasploits, vulnerability scanners and or fancy proxies were used. My toolset consisted out of netcat, nmap and other basic bash commands. There are probably a gazillion ways to do this as lots of this stuff is preference based on how they are approached. However, the basic ideas of the vulnerabilities remain the same.</p>

<p>Recently at a conference that I attended, I sat in a class that was talking about Botnets and general &lsquo;How Easy They Are&rsquo; related things. 90% of the technical discussions did not really come as a surprise to me, however, I came to realize that I am not <strong>100%</strong> aware of how ( and I dare say this lightly ) <em>easy</em> they have it. The technical competency of the adversary really doesn&rsquo;t have to be at a jaw droppingly high level. In fact, if you can operate the keyboard and mouse, heck, even a tablet/phone once its all setup, then you could potentially be a successful botnet operator.</p>

<p>First and foremost, I will start with a warning. Like any other virtualization software, you risk leaving the console open. This is a often overlooked part of securing your infrastructure. An administrator may have been required to do some work on the virtual console, and forget to log out. What if that account that is still logged in, is r00t? Having administrative access to a VM Host gives you access to the consoles, but not necessarily to the guests. Remember to log out! Or, setup shells to auto-logout after a few minutes of inactivity.</p>
