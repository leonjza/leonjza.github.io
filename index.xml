&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/htb-business-ctf-2021">HackTheBox Business CTF 2021&lt;/a> ran this weekend, and I played with a few colleagues at Orange Cyberdefense / SensePost. We managed to score &lt;a href="https://ctf.hackthebox.eu/ctf/131/scoreboard">&lt;em>5th&lt;/em>&lt;/a> place amongst 374 other teams!&lt;/p>

foreword DawgCTF 20201 was the first CTF I played together with some local people much smarter than me over at Hack South. We managed to grab 28th place too.
I only solved three challenges with the time I had in the morning (of which one was a dupe because reading is hard :P).

foreword The HTB Cyber Apocalypse 2021 event was a nice and polished CTF. Apart from the usual start time load issues, everything ran pretty smoothly with nearly zero issues my side. Kudo&amp;rsquo;s HTB! Here are the solutions for the ~20 challenges I managed to solve.

solution unfortunately the infra was down by the time I got to the writeup
We&amp;rsquo;re given an IP and credentials, along with a reference to mosquito. There was also a URL that accepted a username, a password and OTP.
I used MQTT Explorer to connect to the mosquito server. With a bit of patience, an office topic received a message with a &amp;ldquo;u&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;p&amp;rdquo; flag, base64 encoded.</description></item><item><title>NahamCon2021 CTF - Microscopium</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2021/03/15/nahamcon2021-ctf-microscopium/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 17:45:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2021/03/15/nahamcon2021-ctf-microscopium/</guid><description>

solution The challenge URL dropped us on a page related to fitness, with not a lot of interesting interactions.
Navigating the pages you&amp;rsquo;d see a URL scheme where a page parameter is set. Eg: page=about. An about.php also exists, so this was potentially vuln to LFI. Using .. in the page parameter resulted in a warning message indicating that some filtering was taking place.

solution We&amp;rsquo;re given an archive to download, agenttester.zip. This contained a Dockerfile and a python web application. The files in the archive had many secrets redacted which were set using environment variables. One specifically interesting one was CHALLENGE_FLAG, which we could assume was the target value to leak.
The challenge URL dropped us on a page where we need to login.

That resulted in &lt;a href="https://github.com/leonjza/ooktools">ooktools&lt;/a> being built to help with making some of that work easier and to help me learn.

&lt;p>Nmap&amp;rsquo;s greppable output is really handy. Saving greppable output from a scan means the output is delimited in a way that can be easily processed using tools such as &lt;code>grep&lt;/code>, &lt;code>sed&lt;/code>, &lt;code>cut&lt;/code> and &lt;code>awk&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Active Directory is almost always in scope for many pentests. There is sometimes a competitive nature amongst pentesters where the challenge is to see who can set a new record for gaining Domain Administrative privileges the fastest. How sad its that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reality is, &lt;em>many&lt;/em> times, the escalation processes is trivial. Pwn some workstation with admin creds, grab credentials out of &lt;code>lsass&lt;/code> and pass the hash to move around laterally. This has been the typical breakfast of many pentesters. Heck, there are even attempts to &lt;a href="https://github.com/sensepost/autoDANE">automate&lt;/a> this type of process because, personally, I feel its getting pretty old. Yet, its still very viable as an attack method due to its high success rate!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post however tries to look at it from a little fresher perspective. There are many posts like this out there, but this one is mine. Mostly just a brain dump that I can refer to later. Many others have written this up (maybe even in greater detail), so definitely have a look around!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>license</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/license/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2016 19:08:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/license/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer&lt;/a>, which is most probably &lt;em>the&lt;/em> most popular PHP dependency manager allows for &lt;a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md">scripts&lt;/a> to run as callbacks on based an event.

&lt;p>It is possible to provide shell commands to the &lt;code>scripts&lt;/code> property in the required &lt;code>composer.json&lt;/code> file (with a few restrictions), but this method echoes the command that it executes.
A slightly more covert approach would be to execute a cleverly named static function in a class included in the codebase.

In the case of &lt;a href="http://canarytokens.org">canarytokens&lt;/a>, the phone home features can be either via a DNS or HTTP request coupled with a unique token.

tl;dr Flick II just got published on Vulnhub! You should try it =)
introduction After about a year since Flick I, I have finally managed to get Flick II out to VulnHub. I learned a lot from Flick I and as a result applied it to Flick II. The making of Flick II was also a very different story. If I have to compare it to the first one (which took 3 nights to build start to finish), Flick II took waay longer.</description></item><item><title>jenkins to meterpreter toying with powersploit</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/05/27/jenkins-to-meterpreter-toying-with-powersploit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2015 20:40:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/05/27/jenkins-to-meterpreter-toying-with-powersploit/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Sokar was used as another writeup competition (the first for 2015), similar to the &lt;a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/09/18/from-persistence/">Persistence&lt;/a> challenge from Sep &amp;lsquo;14.
From the &lt;a href="http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/competition-sokar.html">competition announcement blogpost&lt;/a>, the rules of engagement were pretty familiar. Boot the VM, pwn it via the network and find the flag.
Of course, modifying the VM in order to help you get the flag (things like single user mode, rescue disks etc) are not allowed and you have to actually be able to prove how you got r00t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sokar frustrated me. A lot. However, almost all of the challenges and configurations of Sokar were plausible. Most of the vulnerabilities are valid in the sense that it may as well be out there in wild. So, it was a great learning experience once again!&lt;/p>

In a similar scenario, I was poking at a iOS application that also had some root detection built in. For very much the same purpose, I suppose the application has its own ~reasons~ for the jailbreak detection.

&lt;p>So, its was time to try and bypass the jailbreak detection of the application.
All I had to work with was a &lt;code>.ipa&lt;/code>. Similar to the android &lt;code>.apk&lt;/code> file, the &lt;code>.ipa&lt;/code> is also just a zipped up archive of the actual application files. To test with, I had a iPad mini. The iPad was running the latest iOS (8.1.2 at the time of this post) and was also jailbroken. If I remember correctly the jailbreak tool used was called TaiG. Anyways, inside the applications &lt;code>.ipa&lt;/code> archive was a whole bunch of resource files and what not, including the compiled application executable. This executable is what is of interest.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>no more jailbreak detection an adventure into Android app reversing and smali patching</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/02/09/no-more-jailbreak-detection-an-adventure-into-android-app-reversing-and-smali-patching/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2015 19:10:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/02/09/no-more-jailbreak-detection-an-adventure-into-android-app-reversing-and-smali-patching/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I will start by saying that I am by &lt;em>no means&lt;/em> a expert in anything you are about to read. I am also not 100% sure about the correct terminology for this type of patching. Maybe it should have been called binary patching? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but I do know that I was quite literally shocked by the ease of getting this job done, and figured its time to make some notes for me to reflect on later again.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Recently I had the opportunity to poke at an Android &lt;code>.apk&lt;/code>. My task was a little different from what I am about to blog about, but the fundamental idea remained the same. I wanted to inspect some traffic of an application, but the application had jailbreak detection built in and refused to run if the device its running on is detected as jailbroken. This had to be bypassed first. To play with the &lt;code>apk&lt;/code>, I needed to get some tools setup and learn a few things about the Android environment &lt;em>really&lt;/em> fast. There are tons of resources available online to describe to you the general idea behind Android, as well as how its all stitched together. You will quickly come to realize that apps can be written in Java. For the purpose of this post, the focus is to bypass the jailbreak detection the &lt;code>apk&lt;/code> had and let it continue normal operations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>hoof to root solving pegasus 1</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/12/23/hoof-to-root-solving-pegasus-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2014 08:29:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/12/23/hoof-to-root-solving-pegasus-1/</guid><description>

Pegasus had its fair share of frustrations and had me digging around quite a bit. I did however learn a very valuable lesson&amp;hellip; &lt;em>again&lt;/em>. You will see this in the &lt;strong>my_first&lt;/strong> section.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like many other write ups I do, I will also recommend you try this one first before you read on. For me, Pegasus was definitely slightly more difficult than the usual VulnHub stuff you would see, but part of that may just as well be due to fatigue and that year end holiday mode ;p.

&lt;p>As you may know, I recently completed the Penetration testing with Kali Linux training and obtained OSCP certification. It was an amazing experience and really taught me more than just &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;hacking stuff&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>. Instead, the training came coupled with self discipline and endurance. By day I make a living in the IT security field, by night, I tinker, research and learn!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With PWK over, not long after that, I was privileged enough to be presented with a opportunity to beta test a new product that &lt;a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Security&lt;/a> is planning to launch around January 2015 referred to as&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As I am writing this post, it&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;morning after&amp;rdquo; I have received the much awaited email confirming that I have successfully completed the OSCP Certification requirements!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to obtain OSCP Certification, one must complete some time in the Penetration Testing with Kali Linux labs followed by a grueling 24 hour exam challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One really big realization that I came to was the fact that one should not attempt to do this if your goal is simply to get the OSCP Certification. Doing PWK is a excellent opportunity to learn and rushing it may cause you to not make it in the exam.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At the time of writing this post, this VM was part of a local security communities (&lt;a href="http://zacon.org.za/">zacon&lt;/a>) pre-con challenge. Finding /root/flag.txt would have entered you into a draw for winning a prize :D However, the greater goal of the challenge was to learn something. I set out some time and attempted the challenge. Fortunately, I managed to complete it in time. So, this is the journey I took to solve this. You can now download and try this VM yourself over at &lt;a href="http://vulnhub.com/entry/devrandom_relativity,55/">VulnHub&lt;/a>. Unzip, mount and boot the VM. Once the VM is booted, it should have an IP assigned via DHCP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it is interesting to note that I used a very limited set of tools to complete this. No bruteforcers, metasploits, vulnerability scanners and or fancy proxies were used. My toolset consisted out of netcat, nmap and other basic bash commands. There are probably a gazillion ways to do this as lots of this stuff is preference based on how they are approached. However, the basic ideas of the vulnerabilities remain the same.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zeus My Adventure with a Infamous Bot</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/09/23/zeus-my-adventure-with-a-infamous-bot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/09/23/zeus-my-adventure-with-a-infamous-bot/</guid><description>

&lt;p>First and foremost, I will start with a warning. Like any other virtualization software, you risk leaving the console open. This is a often overlooked part of securing your infrastructure. An administrator may have been required to do some work on the virtual console, and forget to log out. What if that account that is still logged in, is r00t? Having administrative access to a VM Host gives you access to the consoles, but not necessarily to the guests. Remember to log out!

In case you have not heard of &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/gource/">Gource&lt;/a> before, I highly suggest you take a few minutes and check out the project home page &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/gource/">here&lt;/a>. If you have been developing, or are part of a development project that has been around a while, then Gource should be able to tell you a tale in a strangely mesmerising way about its progression. Go ahead, download and install it. You are going to need it to try the rest of the stuff anyways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Be warned though, watching the output is highly addictive and strangely entertaining, so if you value your productivity, &lt;strong>don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/strong> continue reading this post.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Lets start by saying that I am by &lt;em>no&lt;/em> means an expert at any of what I am about to write. Primarily this post is purely for research purposes. Think of it as one of those &lt;em>something to do&lt;/em> scenarios. I&amp;rsquo;d like to cover some basics around HTTP Authentication, and then show a PoC of how this can be abused in a real world scenario. Hopefully this will help educate people to use more secure authentication mechanisms! :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quick Win: Quickly Execute Last Shell Command</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/06/23/quick-win-quickly-execute-last-shell-command/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/06/23/quick-win-quickly-execute-last-shell-command/</guid><description>
Work clever, not hard This will be the first post of a series of quick shell tips for getting things done, fast. Infact, it will probably just serve as a notepad for me on the topic ;)
Last shell command If you are using a shell, such as Bash, which is pretty much the default on most Linux distributions, then you probably know that you can just use the up arrow to get the last command.</description></item><item><title>Jabber to Email using SleekXMPP</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/06/07/jabber-to-email-using-sleekxmpp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/06/07/jabber-to-email-using-sleekxmpp/</guid><description>
&lt;h3 id="so-why-would-you-even-want-this">So, why would you even want this..?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Well, to be honest, I am not really sure of many use cases for this, however maybe someone, somewhere will need to do something like this, and I would have done my deed and saved someone some time ::sun::&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="introducing-sleekxmpp">Introducing SleekXMPP&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sleekxmpp.com/">SleekXMPP&lt;/a> is a python XMPP framework. It takes a bit to get your head around it, but once you have some basics covered its quite a rewarding library to work with. :) To start, you need to install 2 dependencies. Python Mailer and SleekXMPP itself. Something like &lt;code>pip install mailer sleekxmpp&lt;/code> or for the older school, &lt;code>easy_install sleekxmpp mailer&lt;/code> should do the trick. It can&amp;rsquo;t hurt to check if the distro you use has these are packages already too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To: Extremely simple python Jabber Broadcast Bot</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/05/25/how-to-extremely-simple-python-jabber-broadcast-bot/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/05/25/how-to-extremely-simple-python-jabber-broadcast-bot/</guid><description>
&lt;h3 id="bots-bots-bots">Bots! Bots! Bots!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Generally speaking, a &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;bot&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; is something that like &lt;em>does work for you&lt;/em>. But, for this purpose, the need for a jabber bot came from the fact that I had to deal with a lot of email on a daily basis. This large amount of mail sometimes would cause me to completely miss critical mail alerts. Realising later that I could have prevented a catastrophe if I didn&amp;rsquo;t miss that &lt;strong>one&lt;/strong> email was just not on anymore. So, I started investigating ways to get the &lt;em>important&lt;/em> stuff delivered faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a team at work, we have long gone dropped the whole Skype group chat thing for our own Jabber server. My privacy related concerns back then was recently heightened &lt;a href="http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/2013-May/004224.html">here&lt;/a> when a trap URL received a HEAD request from &lt;strong>65.52.100.214&lt;/strong>. The user that received the URL in a chat was under strict instructions not to actually click it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World!

&lt;p>Finally! A blog engine I like! :) No exceptionally bloated backend database with plugins that just get hacked. Yup, slim and sleek. &lt;em>And&lt;/em>, I get to make posts using Vi :D
Want in on this love? Have a look at &lt;a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress&lt;/a> . Yes, it was a real ball ache to get setup thanks to the ruby dependencies, but now that were rollin' this should be good :D&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://leonjza.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leonjza.github.io/about/</guid><description>
